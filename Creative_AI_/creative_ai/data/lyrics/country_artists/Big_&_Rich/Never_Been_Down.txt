I'm a little bit crazy
I'm a little bit reckless with this life
Well, I don't worry 'cause Heaven's on my side

When you're walking on water
The waves, they try to knock you down
You'll beg and borrow to go another round

Throw the cards on the table
Hit me once, then hit me again
I'm not afraid 'cause I'm able, to win
It's like I've never been down before
Like I've never been down
It's like I've never been down before
Like I've never been'

Too afraid to risk it
Double down and bet it all
'Cause if you're ever gonna win it,
You got to make the call

Throw the cards on the table
Hit me once, then hit me again
I'm not afraid 'cause I'm able, to win
It's like I've never been down before
Like I've never been down
It's like I've never been down before
Like I've never been'

Inside the black or red
I never lose my head
As long as I get to play
You'll never see me frown
No matter up or down
I'm still in the game

Throw the cards on the table
Hit me once, then hit me again
I'm not afraid 'cause I'm able, to win
It's like I've never been down before
Like I've never been down
It's like I've never been down before
Like I've never been down''''''&''&&'''&''&&'''''&&'''
