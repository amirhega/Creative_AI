Well, I walk into the room
Passing out hundred dollar bills
And it kills and it thrills
Like the horns on my Silverado grill

And I buy the bar a double round of Crown
And everybody's getting down
An' this town ain't never gonna be the same

'Cause I saddle up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
'Cause the girls they are so pretty

Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say, "Save a horse, ride a cowboy"
Everybody says, "Save a horse, ride a cowboy"

Well I don't give a dang
About nothing I'm singing and bling blanging
While the girls are drinking
Long necks down

And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy
Or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
Or your freak parade
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town

And I saddle up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
'Cause the girls they are so pretty

Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say, "Save a horse, ride a cowboy"
Everybody says, "Save a horse, ride a cowboy"

I'm a thoroughbred, that's what she said
In the back of my truck bed
As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
Out on some back country road

We were flying high, fine as wine
Having ourselves a big and rich time
And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go

But her evaluation
Of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for salvation
All night long

So I took her out, giggin' frogs
Introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Willie Nelson song I could think of
And we made love

And I saddled up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
'Cause the girls they are so pretty

Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say, "Save a horse, ride a cowboy"
Everybody says, "Save a horse, ride a cowboy"

What? What?
"Save a horse, ride a cowboy"
Everybody says, "Save a horse, ride a cowboy"''''''&''&''&''''''''
