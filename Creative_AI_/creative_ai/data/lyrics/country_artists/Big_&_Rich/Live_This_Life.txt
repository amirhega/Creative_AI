Met a man on the street last night, he said his name was Jesus
Met a man on the street last night
Thought he was crazy till I watched Him heal a blind man
I watched Him heal a blind man, now I see

I'll live this life until this life won't let me live here anymore
Then I will walk, yes I will walk with patience through that open door
I have no fears, angels follow me wherever I may go
I'll live this life until this life won't let me live here anymore

Met a girl in a chair with wheels, but no one else would see her
Met a girl in a chair with wheels
Everyone was so afraid to even look down on her
And she just spread her little wings and flew away

I'll live this life until this life won't let me live here anymore
Then I will walk, yes I will walk with patience through that open door
I have no fears, angels follow me wherever I may go
I'll live this life until this life won't let me live here anymore

Live here anymore
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Met a kid on a bridge last night, comtemplating freedom (oh)
Met a kid on a bridge last night
And he said, "I'm tired of this maddening life and I'm ready to go meet Jesus"
I said, "He's a friend of mine, met Him just last night, and it's all right, yeah"
It's all right, yeah

I'll live this life until this life won't let me live here anymore
Then I will walk, yes I will walk with patience through that open door
I have no fears, angels follow me wherever I may go
I'll live this life until this life won't let me live here anymore

Live here anymore
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Met a man on the street last night, said his name was Jesus
Met a man on the street last night
