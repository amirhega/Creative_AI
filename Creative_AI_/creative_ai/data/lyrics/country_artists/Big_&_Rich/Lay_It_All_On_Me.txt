Happiness is a state of mind, a place so hard for us to find
Ain't no map and the road just winds, on and on

I don't know who calls the shots, who wrote the book or connects the dots
I can only pray our hearts be satisfied

So lay it all on me baby
Lay it all on me
Yeah I'll always be here for you and when the world is going crazy
Yeah lay it all on me

I've got every element since I met what heaven sent
Now this feeling of content goes on and on
It don't matter where we go, how high we fly or how low
One thing that I know for sure, I'll be satisfied

So lay it all on me baby
Lay it all on me
Yeah I'll always be here for you and when the world is going crazy
Yeah lay it all on me

You can never get close enough to me

So lay it all on me baby
Lay it all on me
Yeah I'll always be here for you and when the world is going crazy
Yeah lay it all on me''''&''&''&''&''&''''&''
