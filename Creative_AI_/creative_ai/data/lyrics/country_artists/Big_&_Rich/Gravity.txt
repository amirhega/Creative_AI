They say gravity
Keeps our feet on the ground
It's just something you can't get around
It's just the way it is
But when I'm flying high
Tangled up with you at night
Ain't no doubt in my mind
What makes us spin

Lovers make the world go round
Like nothing else on this Earth
Love keeps our head above the clouds
When the rain is beating down
I can count on you
You can always lean on me
I know we're gonna carry through
'Cause that's what lovers do
Lovers make the world go round
And round and round and round and round
Lovers make the world go round
And round and round and round and round

We get all caught up in
Things that don't mean nothing
Push us so far
It'll test our faith
So let's pull a little closer
Take the weight off of our shoulders
And remember there's one thing
That'll never change

Lovers make the world go round
Like nothing else on this Earth
Love keeps our head above the clouds
When the rain is beating down
I can count on you
You can always lean on me
I know we're gonna carry through
'Cause that's what lovers do
Lovers make the world go round
And round and round and round and round
Lovers make the world go round
And round and round and round and round''''&''&''&''&''&''''''&''&
