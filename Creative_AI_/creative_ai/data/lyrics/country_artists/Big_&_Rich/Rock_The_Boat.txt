Gonna rock, gonna rock, gonna rock the boat
Gonna slam a jam with a brand new note
Bangin' my head like a billy goat
Gonna rock, gonna rock, gonna rock the boat

Gonna grab a jug, have me a sip
Gonna dance a jig until my backbone slips
Jump on in, see if you float
Gonna rock, gonna rock, gonna rock the boat

Well, I play it fast and I play it slow
Make a move everywhere I go
I push it hard and I lay it back
My longhorn horns on a Cadillac

Kicking up dust with a cockeyed smile
See me comin' for a country mile
All I'm doin' is a doin' my thing
Put a little turbo in my twang
Make it crash, boom, bang, well

Gonna rock, gonna rock, gonna rock the boat
Gonna slam a jam with a brand new note
Bangin' my head like a billy goat
Gonna rock, gonna rock, gonna rock the boat

Gonna grab a jug, have me a sip
Gonna dance a jig until my backbone slips
Jump on in, see if you float
Gonna rock, gonna rock, gonna rock the boat

Are you picking up what I'm putting down?
Are you getting all buck wild in the crowd?
Bobbing your head, stomping them Red Wings
To your own thang

Down in the club with the purple drank
A long neckin' on a river bank
A tie dyed, a camouflage
Uptown in the Moosehead lodge, it's bon voyage

Gonna rock, gonna rock, gonna rock the boat
Gonna slam a jam with a brand new note
Bangin' my head like a billy goat
Gonna rock, gonna rock, gonna rock the boat

Gonna grab a jug, have me a sip
Gonna dance a jig until my backbone slips
Jump on in, see if you float
Gonna rock, gonna rock, gonna rock the boat

Gonna rock, rock, rockin' the boat
Everybody rockin' the boat
(Everybody rockin' the boat)
Gonna rock, rock, rockin' the boat
Everybody rockin' the boat

Gonna rock, rock, rockin' the boat
Everybody rockin' the boat
(Everybody rockin' the boat)
Gonna rock, rock, rockin' the boat
Everybody rockin' the boat

A lil' sump'm sump'm in my glass, smooth sippin'
Walk into the venue, everybody start trippin'
Music so loud, the speakers started clippin'
Got me bangin' my head so hard, my neck crickin'

People walkin' up, shakin' hands, hi-fivin' with all my bros
Like we're drafted by the pros
Now you know the phantasmagorical flow
Hands to the sky when you're out at the show

(Gonna rock, rock, rockin' the boat)
Don't tip the pontoon, gotta keep it afloat
(Gonna rock, rock, rockin' the boat)
Hear the southern accent comin' out of his throat

Gonna rock, rock, rockin' the boat
Everybody rockin' the boat
Gonna rock, rock, rockin' the boat
Everybody rockin' the boat

Gonna rock, gonna rock, gonna rock the boat
Gonna slam a jam with a brand new note
Bangin' my head like a billy goat
Gonna rock, gonna rock, gonna rock the boat

Gonna grab a jug, have me a sip
Gonna dance a jig until my backbone slips
Jump on in, see if you float
Gonna rock, gonna rock, gonna rock the boat

Gonna rock, gonna rock, gonna rock the boat
Gonna slam a jam with a brand new note
Bangin' my head like a billy goat
Gonna rock, gonna rock, gonna rock the boat

Gonna grab a jug, have me a sip
Gonna dance a jig until my backbone slips
Jump on in, see if you float
Gonna rock, gonna rock, gonna rock the boat''''&''&''&''&''&''''&''
