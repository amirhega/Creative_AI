There's a girl on channel 13
I know she's gonna fall in love with me
And I'm gonna win the lottery tomorrow, or the next day

I drive a Mercedes-Benz
I've got a whole butt load of friends
I'm gonna be on CMT someday

But in my real world
Things don't always turn out so good
Like you wish they would
In my real world
I'm a little bit messed up and broke, don't you know

I got more money than George Strait
I throw Benjies out the window all day
Just to see how far they fly, bye bye

I get more girls than the president
Mom and Dad still pays the rent
And I throw parties all night long

But in my real world
Things don't always turn out so good
Like you wish they would
In my real world
I'm a little bit messed up and broke, don't you know (3x)

I'm a rock star, I'm a cowboy, everybody loves this song
I'm a rock star, I'm a cowboy, everybody sing along (2x)

I've got a spaceship fully equipped, 'cause I'm a cowboy Stevie Wonder (2x)

Green, green grass and a rubber Russian bimbo
No one's got a name for the brain in a scarecrow
How can he believe all he sees on the TV
Nothin' but extreme overexecuted fantasy
Happy dancin feet down the street on the corner
Some they say he's silly, some they say that he's a loner
How can you explain he's got a name'nobody knows it
Did anybody ever stop and offer him a Prozac
Prozac, Prozac, Prozac (2x)''''''&''&&'''&''&&'''''''
