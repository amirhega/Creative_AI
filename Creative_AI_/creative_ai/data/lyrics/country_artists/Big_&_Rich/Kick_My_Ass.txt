Well I walked up to the bar
I laid down my platinum card
Then I ordered fifty longnecks for my new friends
Well the barmaid passed them out
And before we chugged them down
I held mine up, said, "Here's to us" and then
This blonde slid up to me, she said, "that was awful sweet"
And then I saw her boyfriend as wide as he was tall
Well he broke up our hug, with a six-foot-five inch shove
And I found myself slammed up against the wall

Why does everybody want to kick my ass
I'm just trying to have a little fun for all the ones who can't
And just because I kiss the prettiest girls and I drive my truck too fast
Why does everybody want to kick my ass

Well I never been the type to walk up and pick a fight
I've always been the kind to get along
I throw parties all the time, and they're always on my dime
We drink and dance and smoke until the dawn
Well my style of stress relief, sometimes disturbs the peace
The police show up, cut donuts in my yard
And while the zeppelin's playin' loud, they run off my party crowd
They cuff my wrists and throw me down so hard

Why does everybody want to kick my ass
I'm just trying to have a little fun for all the ones who can't
And just because I kiss the prettiest girls and I drive my truck too fast
Why does everybody want to kick my ass

And just because I kiss the prettiest girls and I drive my truck too fast
Why does everybody want,
It seems like everybody wants,
Why does everybody want to kick my ass!''''''&''&&'''&''&&'''''''
