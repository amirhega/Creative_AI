Brothers and sisters
We are here for one reason and one reason alone
To share our love of music
I present to you
Country music without prejudice, hey

Country boys don't rock and roll
Yeah, the record man told me so
You'll never get it on the radio
Why they trying to complicate
The simple music that we make
Oh, 'cause if it moves my soul
I'm gonna keep on rollin', rollin'

Hey
Just wanna hear everybody sing (rollin', rollin')
At the top of your lungs till the windows break (rollin', rollin')
Say hey
Hey, hey

I ain't gonna shut my mouth
Don't mind if I stand out in a crowd
Just wanna live out loud
Well, I know there's got to be
A few hundred million more like me
Just trying to keep it free, yeah

Hey
Just wanna hear everybody sing (rollin', rollin')
At the top of your lungs till the windows break (rollin', rollin')
Say hey
Hey, hey

Charlie Pride was the man in black
Rock and roll used to be about Johnny Cash
Yeah, whatcha think about that
Well, I'm a crazy son-of-a (bad word)
But I know I'm gonna make it big and rich
Yeah, I'm gonna let it rip

Hey
Just wanna hear everybody sing (rollin', rollin')
At the top of your lungs till the windows break (rollin', rollin')
Say hey
Cowboy Troy

Dum-diggity-dum, diggity-diggity-dum dig this
Slicker than the grease from a barbecue briskit
Got more chunk than a fresh potato salad
You thought you had your answer
But your answer was invalid
You're looking at me crazy 'cause you think I'm loco
The big black cowboy with the crazy vocal
Todas las personas gritando arriva
Now you heard it, now I know you a believer
Esta cancion es para toda la gente
Muy importante a usar su mente
So let go of all your preconcieved notions
Get up on your feet and put your body in motion
'Cause back home, we love to dance
We could be two-stepin' or ravin' to trance
And when the party is crunk, the girls back it up
We got the systems in the cars and the 20s on the trucks
Six-foot-four with a cowboy hat
I don't mess around, yo, wassup with that
I'm Cowboy Troy, a Texas hick
And I'm rollin' with the brothers, Big and Rich

Go cowboy, go cowboy go (go cowboy, go cowboy go)
Go cowboy, go cowboy go (go cowboy, go cowboy go)

Hey
Just wanna hear everybody sing (rollin', rollin')
At the top of your lungs till the windows break (rollin', rollin')
Say hey
Hey, hey

Hey
Just wanna hear everybody sing (rollin', rollin')
At the top of your lungs till the windows break (rollin', rollin')
Say hey
Hey, hey'''&'''&''&'&''&&''&''&'&''&&''&'''&''&&''&'''&
