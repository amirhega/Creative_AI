It's so dark in here, I can't begin
To find a shred of light, this place I'm in
But even in this cold
I can still find beautiful

'Cause you're never far away
No you're never far away
I close my eyes and then, there you are again
Never far away, never far away

The chill in here, collecting on my skin
Reminds me I'm alive, I gotta try again
And when there's nothing left
I just look inside myself

'Cause you're never far away
No you're never far away
I close my eyes and then, there you are again
Never far away, never far away

Walking through these halls, it wears me down
All these people with their foolish frowns
But when I need to hear, sweet music in my ear

No you're never far away
No you're never far away
I close my eyes and then, there you are again
Never far away, never far away
Never far away''''&''&''&''&''&''''&''
