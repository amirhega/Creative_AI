We got Detroit diesels are burning
And a couple hundred good years are turning
Got a convoy hellbound headed to your hometown
Fueling up on smoking crown

All them girls lined up in bikinis
And sipping on their noon time martinis
If you wanna party with the band get a stamp on your hand
But you better shake it just like you mean it

You know I come to git down
Right here in your party town
Play some country rock and roll
Stomp a big mud hole
Get 20,000 people spinning out of control
I come to git down
Oh I come to git down

I see tailgating boys that are joking
And the girls are already smoking
So hold up your lighters
I go walking cross the fire
And take this round a little bit higher

You know I come to git down
Right here in your party town
Play some country rock and roll
Stomp a big mud hole
Get 20,000 people spinning out of control
I come to git down

Say hey hey hey yeah
Say hey hey hey yeah
I said hey little lady now what you think maybe
Tell us baby what's your name
If you wanna feel the heat then come up here with me
And baby watch my guitar play

I come to git down
Right here in your party town
Play some country rock and roll
Stomp a big mud hole
Get 20,000 people spinning out of control
I come to git down
Yes I come to git down
Oh I come to git down
Yes I come to git down

Oh I come to git down''''&''&''&''&''&''''&''&
