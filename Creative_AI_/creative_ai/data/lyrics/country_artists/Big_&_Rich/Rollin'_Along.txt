Another crowded party parking lot
Everybody's showing everything they got
Ain't no sense in us, just sticking around here
Let's sling a little gravel, baby, grab another gear

Let's get to rollin', rocking along
Leanin' in closer to a wide open song
Catch ourselves a memory before the moment is gone
Let's get to rollin' rollin' babe
Let's get to rollin' rollin' rollin' along
You're rollin' along

Shifting the four low and creeping on in
Between the creek and the limestone moon shining in
Mixtaping it up on a tailgating bar
Sippin' on gin and juice, tumblin' under the stars

Let's get to rollin', rocking along
Leanin' in closer to a wide open song
Catch ourselves a memory before the moment is gone
Let's get to rollin' rollin' babe
Let's get to rollin' rollin' rollin' along
You're rollin' along

Life can get you caught up like you're running on a spinning wheel
Gotta take it while we got it, let's remember how good it feels

Rollin'
Let's get to rollin' on
Rollin'
Let's get to rollin' on

Let's get to rollin', rocking along
Leanin' in closer to a wide open song
Catch ourselves a memory before the moment is gone
Let's get to rollin' rollin' babe
Let's get to rollin' rollin' babe
Let's get to rollin' rollin' rollin' along
Rollin' along
Rollin' along
Rollin' along'''''&'''&'''&'''&'''&''''''&'''&'
