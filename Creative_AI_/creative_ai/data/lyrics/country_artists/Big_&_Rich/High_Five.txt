Run, and I will run with you
Faster than light can move,
And as far as you want to
Wings, maybe we don't have wings
But we can do anything, anything

Look at me I'm dreamin'
I just gave the moon a high five
Don't you know that freedom
Freedom is a place in your mind

Laugh, I'll laugh and cry with you
Until the grass turns blue
And the sky bright green
'Cause I... I don't want anything
Less than everything here with you

If we let go, maybe we'll rise
Up through the clouds, and find a new high
Baby let go
Baby let go
Baby let go

Look at me I'm dreamin'
I just gave the moon a high five''''''&''&''&''&''''''
