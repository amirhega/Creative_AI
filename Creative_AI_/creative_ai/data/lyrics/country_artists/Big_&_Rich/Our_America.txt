We the people of the United States 
In order to form a more perfect union
I have a dream, a dream that one day 
We hold these truths to be self evident 
That all men are created equal and 
They are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights
And that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness

Oh say can you see by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed 
At the twilights last gleaming

I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America

Who's bright stripes and bright stars 
Through the periless fights
O'er the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming

And to the Republic for which is stands
One nation under God

And the rockets red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there

Indivisible

Oh say does that Star Spangled Banner yet wave

With liberty and justice for all

O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave''''&'''&''&'''&''&'''''&'''
