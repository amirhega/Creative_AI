I like women and I like wine
Smokin' and joking with friends of mine
Loud guitars playing in bars
Groovin' bass lines from my go-fast car
'Cause I love my job and I work real hard
And I get chicks 'cause I play guitar

Don't need to be a big-screen movie star
Or an NFL quarterback throwing so far
Give me neon lights and Saturday nights
A headache in the morning lets me know I'm alive
Yeah I love my job and I work real hard
And I get chicks, 'cause I play guitar

No, I may not be the biggest fish in this town
But some still say that I'm the baddest thing around
Yeah I love my job and I work real hard
And I get chicks, 'cause I play guitar

No, I may not be the biggest fish in this town
But some still say I'm the baddest thing around

I use a beer bottle for a guitar slide
I hang on a note and I twang it all night
I'll bend them strings and light it in flames
Yeah I slide on the stage and I walk on the bar
And I get chicks 'cause I play guitar
Yeah I love my job and I work real hard
And I get chicks 'cause I play guitar'''''&'''&'''&'''&'''&''''''&''''
