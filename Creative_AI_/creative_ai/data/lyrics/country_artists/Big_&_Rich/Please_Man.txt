"Big and Rich, Wyclef Jean
There goes the neighborhood, oh oh"

Please man
Don't call the police, man
Why can we just be friends?
And try to get along

I don't want to hurt no one
I just want to have a little fun
So I'm begging you please man
Don't call the police, man

I didn't know
The stereo was playing so loud (turn it up)
Didn't know
The Go-Go girls were dancin' (shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it)
It's out of sight, it's alright
So let me get you a cold Red Stripe

And please man
Don't call the police, man
Why can we just be friends?
And try to get along (we don't like those country records)

Don't want to hurt no one
Just want to have a little fun
So I'm begging you please man
Don't call the police, man

I didn't mean to cause a scene
Make anyone mad
For goodness sake, no need to hate
We were just playin'

So count to 10 (10,9,8,7)
And do it again (6,5,4,3)
And do anything you like my friend (2, 1, 1, 1, 1)

And please man
Don't call the police man
Why can we just be friends?
And try to get along (we don't like those country records)

Don't want to hurt no one
I just want to have a little fun
So I'm begging you please man
Don't call the police, man

Check my country swagger, check it
I dress in black
Like the late Johnny Cash
Snatch some cash and grass
From Willie Nelson (Why you undercover)

Let's split the profits (man)
I'm a gambler like Kenny Rogers
My t-shirt says, "The Devil Went Down To Georgia"
Like Charlie Daniels (yee-hah)

Back in my crib, I'm watchin' "Reba"
I hear the helicopters
The police the door down
Now I'm gettin' judged by the judge
I got acquitted because they love the cowboys
Cowgirls ask me Wyclef Jean
Why you be seen with those Big and Rich Boys?

Be friends and try to get along
Don't want to hurt no one
I just want to have a little fun
So I'm begging you please man
Don't call the police, man

Yeah I'm beggin you please man
Don't call the police, man''''''''''&''&''&''&''''''''
