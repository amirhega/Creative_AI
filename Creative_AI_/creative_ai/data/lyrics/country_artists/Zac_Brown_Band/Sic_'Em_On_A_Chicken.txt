"You thought we were done, huh?
We got more!"

Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch those feathers fly
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Break out the butter and the flour ready to fry

My dog Pete is the smallest dog
Of all the dogs in my yard (that's right)
He's a mean som bitch, drinks Beam and water
From a broken mason jar

And we sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch those feathers fly
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Break out the butter and the flour ready to fry

I heard this awful noise comin' outta the woods
(Comin' outta the woods)
I heard chicken screams and I knew it wasn't gon' be good

I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken 'cause I just heard him cry
I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken
But you can get another one for a dollar seventy nine

In a couple of years, his spurs had grown
He wasn't safe to keep around the home
And he almost took an eyeball from Lonnie's son
And I was in the kitchen makin' fig preserves
And I heard that young'un get kicked in the face
And I knew it was a day that rooster's gonna get what he deserves

So I chased the chicken
I chased the chicken
I chased the chicken and Pete hit him from the side
I chased the chicken
I chased the chicken
And me and Pete suppered on a homemade chicken pot pie

Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch those feathers fly
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
I can smell the kitchen and it's almost supper time

"You damn right I like my chicken fried, yeah!"'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
