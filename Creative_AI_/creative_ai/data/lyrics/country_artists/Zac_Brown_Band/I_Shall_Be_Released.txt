They say everything can't be replaced
And every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
And any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say every man must fall
But I swear I see my reflection
Well, somewhere high above that wall

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who says he's not to blame
But all day long I hear him crying so loud
Crying out he's been framed

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released''''''''''''''''''
