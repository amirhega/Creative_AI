Thirty thousand feet above
The city where I fell in love with you
And the fading country skyline
Brings an urban lullaby that still rings true
When I passed you on the street that day
Shoulda let that rest gon' fly away
Like any chance I had of keeping you
Like the northern wind a blowin'
Yeah, my lonely heart is frozen
Never knew I'd find a way to break yours too

Where the wind blows, babe, you can bet
I'll be riding high within
Holding on for my dear life just like I always did
Close your eyes, babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere, anywhere my love

The city lights look like the country sky
We're staring at the stars turn upside down
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find it in your heart to stick around
I hate it had to end this way
Tomorrow is a brand new day
And the chances of seeing love are precious few
If someone's out there waiting
For a sweet good time and lady
To make you smile the way I always wanted to

Where the wind blows, babe, you can bet
I'll be riding high within
Holding on for my dear life just like I always did
Close your eyes, babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere, anywhere my love

So I found out
Our memories, my lullaby and love won't lie
It was love done right
You'll be waiting on the other side
I'm absorbing why, if love don't lie, lie
You can fly

Where the wind blows, babe, you can bet
I'll be riding high within
Holding on for my dear life just like I always did
Close your eyes, babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere, anywhere
My love will find you anywhere, anywhere
My love will find you anywhere, anywhere my love''''''''''''''''''
