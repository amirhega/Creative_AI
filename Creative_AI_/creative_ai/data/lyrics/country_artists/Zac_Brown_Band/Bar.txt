The last time I swore it was the last time
And the time before I swear I swore the same
Honey this time baby I won't make a promise
I've given up I'm never gonna change

So pass that bottle I'm jumping off this wagon
It never seemed to get me very far
You can say what you will
But I'm drinking till I get my fill
So if your looking darling I'll be at the bar

I've always had this black streak up my back
And the night time plays a song I like to sing
So if you don't like the way I run my shop
My friends don't seem to mind my company

So pass that bottle I'm jumping off this wagon
It never seemed to get me very far
You can say what you will
But I'm drinking till I get my fill
So if your looking darling I'll be at the bar

Tomorrow morning my head it will be ringing
And the look that's in my eyes it may be scary
So I guess ill have to drag myself to the kitchen
And find that bottle of 90 for bloody mary's

So pass that bottle I'm jumping off this wagon
It never seemed to get me very far
You can say what you will
But I'm drinking till I get my fill
So if your looking darling I'll be at the bar''''''''''''''''''
