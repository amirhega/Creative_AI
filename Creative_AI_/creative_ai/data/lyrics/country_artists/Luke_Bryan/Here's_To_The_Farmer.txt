Talk about an uphill battle
2000 acres of beans and cattle
But he don't ever get rattled
He just goes 'til the sun goes down
Hydraulic fluid on his jeans
Red dye diesel and ten rows between
A cold one on the porch and a good nights of sleep
Y'all hold 'em up with me now

Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown
That got him on his feet with handshake money
Here's to the farmer's wife
That loves him every night
Raising a son, raising a daughter
They gather 'round the table, send it up to the Father
Somehow they get closer when times get harder
Here's to the farmer

Subdivision's creeping on in
Neighborhood kids keep jumping his fence
He could double his money
But that'd be the end of a promise he'll never break
'Cause he looked his daddy in the eye
And he's got that stubborn pride
He'll be here 'til the day he dies
No, he wouldn't have it any other way

Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown
That got him on his feet with handshake money
Here's to the farmer's wife
That loves him every night
Raising a son, raising a daughter
They gather 'round the table, send it up to the Father
Somehow they get closer when times get harder
Here's to the farmer

Yeah, here's to the farmer that loves his day in the sun
Won't sell that old half-ton
Nobody knows better 'bout a hard-earned dollar
Just tell him how far he's gotta go and he'll go further
Here's to the farmer
Here's to the farmer
Thank you, boys''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
