Girl I'll be over there
With my buddies drinkin' beer
If you need me, come and get me
When you hear our song
In a little while
When you're ready shoot me that smile
That way I'll know, that its time to go
You got your buzz on

We won't ever look as good as we do now
So let's take another shot, drink another round
Hug on one another, talk about each other
Stay until they kick us out
Nothin' like love in a college town

All the rumors fly
Did you hear who hooked up last night?
Thought she was all about, cause all she talked about
Was some old boy back home
There's old what's-his-name
He just can't seem to graduate
Hittin' on the new crop, buyin' 'em lemon drops
Man that's just wrong!

We won't ever look as good as we do now
So let's take another shot, drink another round
Hug on one another, talk about each other
Stay until they kick us out
Feels like love in a college town

I'm gonna fail this test
Thinking 'bout your dress
Layin' on my floor
Runnin' out the door
A-A-B-A-C, that sounds good to me!

We won't ever look as good as we do now
So let's give it one more shot
Baby how's that sound?
Hug on one another, kiss on each other
In the morning we can chalk it down
As love in a college town

Gotta' love love in a college town''''''''''''''''''
