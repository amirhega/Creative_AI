(Oh oh)
What you doing in this pace?
Well I could probably ask you the same thing
Another round, girl, what you think?
If you're buying, well you know I'll drink
So make a seven and seven
Do you want it on the rocks?
A double shot of heaven
Spilling' off the top

We'll go shot for shot for shot till we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop a night we won't regret
So put your drink down and throw your camera up, flip it around and snap a payback picture
Send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex and send 'em both a text
Saying we ain't we ain't going home alone tonight
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight

Slow country from a cover band, I got you covered if you don't know how to dance
But if you want we could grab a cab... Girl we got all night, I've got a bottomless tab
So lets go...

Shot for shot for shot till we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop a night we won't regret
So put your drink down and throw your camera up, flip it around and snap a payback picture
Send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex and send 'em both a text
Saying we ain't we ain't going home alone tonight
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight

It feels too good to let it end right here (I ain't going home alone home tonight)
So lets not let it end, let it end right here (girl you're going home with me tonight)

So lets go shot for shot for shot till we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop a night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up, flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll Send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex and send 'em both a text
Saying we ain't going home alone tonight
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight

Well I ain't going home alone tonight
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight
If you wanna, I ain't going home tonight
Home alone tonight''''''''''''''''
