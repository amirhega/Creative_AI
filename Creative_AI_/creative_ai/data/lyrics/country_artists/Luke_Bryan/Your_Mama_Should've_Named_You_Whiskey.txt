Just a little taste won't hurt at all
But once I get a sip, I know I'm gonna wanna drink it gone, all gone
90 proof is an understatement
I get around you and I'm way past wasted
I can't think at all

Your mama should've named you whiskey
I never should've let you kiss me
And every time you leave it hits me
Your mama should've named you whiskey

Girl, you got a smile like a devil on my shoulder
Tempting me sayin', honey come over right now, right now
I know I shouldn't wanna, but I think I'm probably gonna
Even though I know I'm gonna be wakin' up hurtin' in the morning
Shoulda come with a warning

Your mama should've named you whiskey
I never should've let you kiss me
Yeah, and every time you leave it hits me
Your mama should've named you whiskey

I'm addicted girl, I'm hangin'; on
I'm a fool in love, I'm long past gone
Yeah, so, come on

Your mama should've named you whiskey
I never should've let you kiss me
Oh, and every time you leave it hits me
Oh baby, your mama should've named you whiskey

I'm addicted girl, such a fool
I'm addicted girl
Such a fool'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
