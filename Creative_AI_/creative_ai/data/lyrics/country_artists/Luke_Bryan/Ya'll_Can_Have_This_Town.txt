Luke Bryan - Y'all Can Have This Town

One pool hall and a rundown cotton gin.
"Come Back Soon" hand painted on a grain bin.
We got a hardware store at the intersection,
Dirt roads runnin' in all directions.
I love this place.
But I gotta go,
'Cause she is gone.

Y'all can have this town
And what I don't grab on my way out.
Cause the only thing I need
Ain't here. She's gone and found her way
To another life in a better place.
But I hear she's missin' me.
Y'all can have this town.

Bet there ain't a single place to fish up there.
No small talk or sweet tea, but I don't care.
It's gonna be worth every thing I have to leave
When I feel her loving arms on me.
Right there's the Interstate.
And I'm turnin' on.
Looks like I'm gone.

Everybody says I'll be back,
Brother don't hold your breath on that
Cause as long as she ain't here.

Y'all can have this town
And what I don't grab on my way out.
Cause the only thing I need
Ain't here. She's gone and found her way
To another life in a better place.
But I hear she's missin' me
Y'all can have this town.'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
