Drop it boys

I say hey man
Whatcha doing later on?
He said aw man
I'm just hanging out later on

I said I'll swing by and get ya
And you'll be there and I bet ya
We can find a little something to do a little later on

I say hey man
What's Jr and them doing later on?
He said aw man
He's gotta check on his momma and them later on

So it looks like you and me
So let's ride around and see
If we can find a little bit of trouble a little later on

Come on!

When the stars come out
And the sun's long gone
We're gonna drink up a lotta beer a little later on
Gonna find a good spot
Crank up a few songs
We're gonna get on outta here a little later on

You know out in the country don't make no plans
Throw it out there, see where it lands
Rockin' out all night and roll back home
A little bit later on

I said hey girl
Whatcha doing later on?
She said
I'm getting off work later on

I said call a couple of your friends
'Cause me and my buddy Ben
We're gonna be back by to get you a little later on

Haha yeah

When the stars come out
And the sun's long gone
We're gonna drink up a lotta beer a little later on
Gonna find a good spot
Crank up a few songs
We're gonna get on outta here a little later on

You know out in the country don't make no plans
Grab a pretty girl, take her by the hand
Rockin' out all night and roll back home
A little bit later on

Meet up with you little bit, little bit, little bit later on
Come on now a little bit, little bit, little bit later on
We're gonna break it all down to the break of dawn
A little bit, little bit, little bit later on

When the stars come out
And the sun's long gone
We're gonna drink up a lotta beer a little later on
We're gonna do it up right
All night long
Gonna worry 'bout tomorrow a little later on

You know out in the country don't make no plans
Find a little bar with a guitar band
Rockin' out all night and roll back home
A little bit later on
A little bit later on

Lay a little bit of rubber down on some asphalt
50 yard line, better not get a butt call
A little bit later on
Find a little spot right down on the creek bank
Really don't care what your momma and daddy might think
A little bit later on
A little bit later on''''''''''''''''''
