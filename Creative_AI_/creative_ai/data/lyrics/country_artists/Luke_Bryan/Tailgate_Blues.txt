I catch my buzz in the black of night,
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows.
If I lose my cool in the open and shows,
That I'm down and I ain't all right.
I search my soul where there is no moon.
The trees all cross and are covered in moss.
If the crickets wanna know, then I'll tell 'em what I lost.
Oh, I've got the tailgate blues.

I ain't sure where it all began.
Somewhere out here, I know.
This bridge was a little more crowded,
Than I was playing a tailgate show.
Now, I'm just sitting here alone.

To catch my buzz in the black of night,
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows.
If I lose my cool in the open and shows,
That I'm down and I ain't all right.
I search my soul where there is no moon.
The trees all cross and are covered in moss.
If the crickets wanna know, then I'll tell 'em what I lost.
Oh, I've got the tailgate blues.

Damn that AM radio, for playing more than a song.
My heart won't beat if the strings are broke.
The melody's hittin' me wrong.
Right here where she belongs.

I catch my buzz in the black of night,
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows.
If I lose my cool in the open and shows,
That I'm down and I ain't all right.
I search my soul where there is no moon.
The trees all cross and are covered in moss.
If the crickets wanna know, then I'll tell 'em what I lost.
Oh, I've got the tailgate blues.

The crickets heard my story.
And I listened to them sing.
Yes, I closed the tailgate up.
Ain't no telling what tomorrow might bring,
Maybe me and a dixie cup.
That won't be enough.

Yes, I catch my buzz in the black of night,
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows.
If I lose my cool in the open and shows,
That I'm down and I ain't all right.
I search my soul where there is no moon.
The trees all cross and are covered in moss.
If the crickets wanna know, then I'll tell 'em what I lost.
Oh, I've got the tailgate blues.

I catch my buzz in the black of night,
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows.
If I lose my cool in the open and shows,
That I'm down and I ain't all right.''''&''''&''''&''''''
