Seventeen, we owned those streets
Parking lot, that was our spot
That's where we'd always meet
And we'd roll on out in a pickup truck parade
Stake our claim with a fire in a field in the middle of Nowhere, USA
We'd light the midnight up

We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
We thought we made the world go 'round
Nothin' but a bunch of time to kill
Set up on the big hill
Make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town

All the girls next door
They'd meet us out there
They couldn't wait to get away
And come and let down their hair
We were rough around the edges
They were sweet as they could be
They were way too good
But they still let us steal a little kiss before they'd leave
Guess they thought we were cool because

We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
Yeah, we thought we made the world go 'round
Drop it down in four-wheel
Set up on a big hill
And make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town

From crazy kids to dirt road kings
Oh, we didn't know nothin'
But we knew everything

We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
We thought we made the world go 'round
Nothin' but a bunch of time to kill
Set up on the big hill
Make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town

High five and look around
Damn right, we run this town
Man, I love this town
Come on''''''''''''''''''
