We've been up here in this city.
Livin' in the grease and grime.
Girl it's a doggone pity
We haven't been gettin' any time.
I've been preachin' bout back home.
It can make you feel so alive.
I'll tell ya what we can do,
Baby let's me and you take a little drive

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby take my arm,
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?
We can take the tractor down the road, go up around the bend
Lay by the river, crawl up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah yeah

There ain't no card in your pocket.
If your gonna turn that old gas pump on
It's cash for everything around here.
That's just the way it's been for so long
How'd you like that coke in a green glass bottle?
It's colder than that plastic stuff
Watch how miss Annie at the counter
Tells that story 'bout me wreckin' my truck

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby take my arm,
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?
We can take the tractor down the road, go up around the bend
Lay by the river, crawl up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah yeah

That straw in your hair,
Not an ounce of makeup on ya
As the sun goes down,
Girl I ain't never seen you lookin' so good
As you do right now

Outro Chorus:
Dancin' on the step side
How bout that blue sky
So pretty it'll make you cry
Welcome to the farm, yeah yeah
Dancing on the stepside,
How bout that blue sky
So pretty it'll make you cry'''''''''''''''''''''
