High beams, you and me
Little back road, barely see
Right song, radio
Throw it in low and drive slow
I saw you and it lit me up
A girl like you, it's just too much

Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights

We can feel our way through
Let me just hold on to you
Baby trust my hands
Live it up while we still can and

Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights

Don't it feel right
Until the sunrise
We can just go on what we know

Can't help but wanna want ya
You wanna do this don't ya
Come here, let me pull you closer
You reach over and

Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights

Kill the lights
Baby you and me, kill the lights
Kill the lights''''''''''''''''''
