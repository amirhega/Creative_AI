We met down at the floatin' dock
She snuck out, scared she might get caught
We were nervous
But it was worth it

There was no such thing as consequence
With her in my arms, it finally made sense
In that moonlight
I saw her tanlines

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her lying there
With her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
A t-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

The fog rolled in, she said I better go
She took my t-shirt and wore it home
A memory, a souvenir
She could keep

So I stayed and watched the sun rise
Like it was waking up my life
To what love was
I can still see us

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her lying there
With her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
A t-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better''''&''''&''''&''''&''
