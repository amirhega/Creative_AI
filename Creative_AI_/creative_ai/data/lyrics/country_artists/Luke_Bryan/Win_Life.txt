Ain't tryna to be hero
Just tryna cash a paycheck
'Til the clock hits zero
Make the most of these days left
Found a few shortcuts
Picked up a couple secrets
Don't have it figured out yet
But I've learned the hard way, it's...

More drunk in love and habits kicked
More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell
More get back up, sometimes you fail
Well, I don't know it all
Hey, but I know how it feels
To be the guy that's trying to come back from behind
Just trying to win life

Man, in a couple scrapes, I barely got out of
Got a couple scars, I kinda ain't proud of
But you can't be afraid to drive until the gas can's empty
And if you're glass is half full, you better make damn sure it's whiskey

And be more drunk in love and habits kicked
More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell
More get back up, sometimes you fail
Well, I don't know it all
Hey, but I know how it feels
To be the guy that's trying to come back from behind
Watching those numbers on the scoreboard clock unwind
Still trying to win life

But if you lose yourself in someone else
Than maybe you don't lose at all

Just be more more drunk in love and habits kicked
More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell
More get back up, sometimes you fail
Well, I don't know it all
Hey, but I know how it feels
To be the guy that's trying to come back from behind
And that hail Mary's coming down on the five yard line
And I'm trying to win life

Just trying to win life
I'll be trying to win life''''''''''''''''''
