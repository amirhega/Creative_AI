Luke Bryan - Goodbye Wasn't Good Enough

Standin' right there, awake and aware,
I heard the words right off your lips.
The meanin' was clear, I saw the tears,
But somehow the message didn't click.
The losin' you part, the break in my heart, just didn't stick.

Girl your, goodbye wasn't good enough.
I'm as in to you as I ever was.
If you'd a done it right, then why ain't I the love.
Must be because, your goodbye wasn't good enough.

Some look in your eye, says there's still time,
Maybe there's one more last chance left.
What you didn't say, when you turned away,
Made me hang on by one more thread.
That shadow of hope, that whisper of smoke, is still in my head.

Girl your, goodbye wasn't good enough.
I'm as in to you as I ever was.
If you'd a done it right, then why ain't I the love.
Must be because, your goodbye wasn't

Good enough to make me see, I don't need you, and you don't need me.''''''''''''''''''''''''
