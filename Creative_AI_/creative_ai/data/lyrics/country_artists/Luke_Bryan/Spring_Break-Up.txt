It was the last night at the Holiday Inn
There was a fire on the beach
I was trying to talk to some other girl
And she was bird-dogging me
I finally had enough
I pulled over to the side
Brushed her hair back and looked her straight in the eye

It was a spring break-up,
Baby don't cry,
You ain't from here and neither am I
We got a little drunk
And had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye

No I don't need your number
Don't want to be your Facebook friend
I hate to break it to ya
But you won't ever see me again
If I'm a bad guy, well I don't mean to be
But there's a beach full of buddies
Acting just like me

Spring break-up,
Baby don't cry,
You ain't from here and neither am I
We got a little drunk
And had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Baby bye bye

Bye bye to the night that we shared
The memories we made on that ol' beach chair
So long to the beer in that kiss
Hope it don't take you long to get over this...

Spring break-up,
Baby don't cry,
You ain't from here and neither am I
I know we got a little drunk
And had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up

Spring break-up,
Baby don't cry,
You ain't from here and neither am I
We got a little drunk
And we had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye''''''''''''''''''
