What gives you courage to walk up to a ten in a bar
What turns the nervous into a rockstar
What gets you through the week then
And right on through the weekend
And puts you back together again

Just a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Gonna be mmhmm so good, mmhmm so nice
Starting this night off so right with...
Just a sip

What makes a good ol' boy start pumping his fist in the sky
What makes a shy girl walk on the wild side
What makes a party better
Makes it last forever
Everybody all together now

Take a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Gonna be mmhmm so good, mmhmm so nice
Starting this night off so right with...
Just a sip

You can chug it down all you want
But you ain't gonna last long
Trust me you can get there with

Just a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Gonna be mmhmm so good, mmhmm so right
Starting this night off so right with...
Just a sip

Takin' one of them big ol' sips''''''''''''''''''
