You and your Sunday mornings
Me and my Saturday nights
You and all your colors
Me and my black and whites
You and your lace and cotton
Up against my whiskey skin
Saving me the way you always do again

'Cause I'm hell up here on the high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm the dust that spins
In a gust of wind that's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain

You and your stained glass windows
Me and my cracked windshield
You and your quiet beauty
Me and my can't sit still

'Cause I'm hell up here on the high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm the dust that spins
In a gust of wind that's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain

Girl I'm hell up here on the high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm the dust that spins
In a gust of wind that's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You're my sweet rain'''''''''''''''''''''''
