My shoulder still burns
My head still burns
There's sand from your shoes in my floorboard
Lipstick on strong, you're crying out
I paint it in my rear view
My speaker still blasts that song
That you turn me on to

It's like that blue water ran up the highway
It's so intense, it's blowing out my tail gate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
'Cause you and the beach follow me home

Still hear your words saying we can't do this
'Cause you're up there and I'm down here
Baby let's go on and face it

It's like that blue water ran up the highway
It's so intense, it's blowing out my tail gate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
'Cause you and the beach follow me home''''''''''''''''''''''
