You got your sundress on for game day
Just to drink beer on an old tailgate
You were born and raised to be a southern belle
But in a place like this you like to raise a little hell
You got your year-round tan
You're on the five year plan
You shake your little pom poms up in the stands

My my my little ADPi
Kappa Delta
Tri Delts you look so fine
Ooh don't know what I'm gonna do around those
Zeta's
Theta's
Chi O's
And little Phi Mu's
Hey Yeah Hey Yeah
My my sorority girl
My my sorority girl

You got that high school boyfriend you still think about
You know how to make him jealous when he comes into town
You drive your little love bug when you're skipping class
And your sisters get you home when you're drunk off your ass
You know how to be a lady
Yeah you're still your daddy's baby
You drive the band and the boys and the bartenders crazy

My my my little ADPi
Kappa Delta
Tri Delts you look so fine
Ooh don't know what I'm gonna do around those
Zeta's
Theta's
Chi O's
And little Phi Mu's
Hey Yeah Hey Yeah
My my sorority girl
My my sorority girl

Ooh here you come again
Walking my way
And there I go again with
Nothing to say
My my my little ADPi
Kappa Delta
Tri Delts you look so fine
Ooh don't know what I'm gonna do around those
Zeta's
Theta's
Chi O's
And little Phi Mu's
Hey Yeah Hey Yeah
My my sorority girl
My my sorority girl
Yeah you rock this county boy's world''''''''''''''''''
