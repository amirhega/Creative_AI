We got beer, and a tub,
And some good lookin' girls
Dressed to the nights,
Lookin' for a good time

Jacked up trucks
Stacked in thick
White rocks stuck
In the mud grips

And a big 'ole bouncer at the door
But don't show him your I.D.
And don't you dare step out on the floor

If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and throw your card down
Knock a shot out
And get yourself in the zone
Yeah, you might as well go on
And head your ass back home
If you ain't here to party

There's a little 'ole Louisiana band
Playin' a swampy jam and brown sugar tans
Lookin' so fine shakin' that thang
In the zydeco cage and purple rain

Raise your drink up in the air
And everybody sing along...
Man, you're here all alone

If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and throw your card down
Knock a shot out
And get yourself in the zone
Yeah, you might as well go on
And carry your ass back home
If you ain't here to party

If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and pick someone out
Maybe make out
And get their number in your phone
Man, the only way that you'll be
Goin' home alone is
If you ain't here to party

Yeah, you better be here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party

Throw your keys on the bar
You ain't drivin' your car
You're here with me
That's how it's gonna be

'Cause we're here to party, baby
Yeah, yeah whoa
If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong Friday night'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
