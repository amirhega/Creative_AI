Girl you and me ain't talking much
I just slam the door and leave in my truck
There ain't nothin' left for us I think enough's enough
I look down see your name there on my phone
Then I hit ignore and just drive on
We've been living like this too long
And there ain't no reason to turn around, baby you can have it all

I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time's the last time baby
I can only change who I am so much
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So I ain't coming back,
I've been there done that

Street by street and town after little town
Feels like I'm on the right road now
I bet you're probably wondering how I could just walk out
I put you high up as I could
And I know I've done everything I should
To try to make a bad thing good
I guess it just took too long for me to see
We weren't meant to be

I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time's the last time baby
I can only change who I am so much
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So I ain't coming back,
I've been there done that

I'll wake up, and I'll start to second guess myself
And I'll crave your touch, oh but I know too well...

That I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time's the last time baby
I can only change who I am so much
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So I ain't coming back,
No, I ain't coming back
I've been there done that''''&''''&''''&''''&''
