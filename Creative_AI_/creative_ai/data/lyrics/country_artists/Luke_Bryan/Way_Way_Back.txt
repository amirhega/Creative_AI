Hey, baby, it's been a minute since
Me and you got caught up in
A little wild and young kinda reckless love
That song that was playing when we first kissed
Yeah, you probably don't think I remember it
Got it in the truck
I can dial it up

Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it

Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back

Baby, don't try to hide that smile
I can see that memory in your mind
Running all around, we can chase it down
You look even better than you did back then
Girl, close your eyes and we'll be there in no time
And we can rewind it

Way, way, back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back

Like an old school song
Two of us just hanging on to the night
Wouldn't you like to go there, baby?

Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it

Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Way, way back
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Way, way back''''''''''''''''''
