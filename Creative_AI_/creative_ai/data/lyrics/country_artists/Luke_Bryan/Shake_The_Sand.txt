From that first second
I laid eyes on you
To them kisses this morning
To right now in this room
You know I've been going crazy over you
Here we are again tonight
Holding on, feeling right

Let's shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes, oh girl
Before you get to lovin' on me...
Let's shake the sand off the sheets

This can't be no buzz from the salt in the air
I ain't never had no drink do me like this, I swear
Feels like I'm spinning around, watching the wind through your hair
And here we are again tonight
Holding on, feeling right
Before I hit the lights

Let's shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes, oh girl
Before you get to lovin' on me...
Let's shake the sand off the sheets

So I'll just keep holdin' on,
Lovin' you all night long

Let's shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes, oh girl
Before you get to lovin' on me...
Let's shake the sand off the sheets
Let's shake the sand off the sheets''''''''''''''''''
