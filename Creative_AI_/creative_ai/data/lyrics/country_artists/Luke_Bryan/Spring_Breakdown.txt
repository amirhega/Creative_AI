It's been a real good run
Playing out here in the sun
Year after year, beer after beer
I've watched this crowd grow
I swear y'all don't know what ya mean to me
It's been something to see
I remember when we started this week long party
And to think that it's over

It makes me wanna spring breakdown
Just thinking about all our good times together
And how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever and ever
Oh but the sand runs out
And we roll back home
And just thinking bout how
This is our last song
I'm bout to spring breakdown

Next year I'll go through pictures
Wishing I was down there with ya hanging out
It'll kill me then, but I'm here right now
So let's raise up our cups
Can't throw 'em up high enough
Let me buy you one last round

Before I spring breakdown
Just thinking about all our good times together
Yeah how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever and ever
But the sand runs out
And we roll back home
And just thinking bout how
This is our last song
I'm bout to spring breakdown

We made this sun tan city yeah all of y'all's
Sing-a-long so loud
We took this beach town over
Y'all don't know it might sound crazy
But y'all gonna make me spring breakdown
Just thinking about all our good times together
And when we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever and ever
Oh but the sand runs out
And we roll back home
And just thinking bout how
This is our last song
I'm bout to spring breakdown
Swear I'm bout to spring breakdown

Y'all up there on them shoulders
The good and bad hangovers
I'm bout to spring breakdown''''''''''''''''''''''
