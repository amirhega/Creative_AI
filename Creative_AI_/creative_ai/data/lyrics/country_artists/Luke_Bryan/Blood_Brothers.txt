We were as young as we were dumb
When we piled in an old pile of junk
It was one for all, and all for one
A bunch of outlaws without a gun
Shootin' bad booze outta Dixie cups
Chasin' every girl that wasn't fast enough
No matter how bad the break or how bad the luck
Or how bad the day we still had us

Blood brothers closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other

Yeah brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers

I got a scar on my cheek from a bar room brawl
Wasn't meant for me but I took the fall
It's a cowboy code it's an unwrote law
When you mess with one you gotta take us all.

Blood brother's closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other

Yeah brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers

Time can fly on by
Everything can change
Until the day we die
We'll always remain
We'll remain
Yeah yeah yeah

Blood brothers closer than you next of kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other

Yeah brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers

Yeah yeah
Oh oh
Blood brothers''''''''''''''''''
