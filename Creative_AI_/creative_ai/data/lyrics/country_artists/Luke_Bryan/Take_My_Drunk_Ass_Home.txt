It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my money's all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Well I worked all week so I could come here
Have a good time and an ice cold beer
But one turned to ten, and ten turned to twenty
And twenty plus an empty bottle's too damn many

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my money's all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Well, it seems that I misplaced my shirt
I can't find my keys for all this parkin' lot dirt
My fall-back plan has done got sad
Cause my ex-girlfriend ain't lookin' half bad

Yeah, it's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my money's all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

"Help me up!
Aw, put me back down, put me back down."

I sucker-punched my best friend
And the bouncer head-locked me on stage with the band
I look like hell; I feel like shit
I think it's time I call it quits

Yeah, it's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my money's all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Yeah, it's time to take my drunk ass home
I twisted up my ankle, can't find my cell phone
Yeah, my lip's all bust and my buzz is gone
It's time to take my drunk ass home

If y'all agree, then sing along...
Yeah, it's time to take my drunk ass home

"Aw, somebody call me a cab... please?"''''''''''''''''''
