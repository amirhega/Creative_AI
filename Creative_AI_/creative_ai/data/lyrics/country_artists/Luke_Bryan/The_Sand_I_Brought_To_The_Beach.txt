Real sad story here y'all
Come on

I pulled her into my right
And we rode down here
Maybe some sun, maybe some quality time
We've had a rocky year
She wasn't ready for me jumping on the bar
And buying everybody them shots
While I was burning off my credit car
She was burning cars out in the parking lot

I think I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Somebody drink one with me
Oh, 'cause I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach

Oh well looks I've done it again
I ruined another one off
Maybe I'm better off a single man
At least down here Panama City

Now that I'm free for the rest of the week
Feel free to tag alone
Whatever y'all need, yeah, it's on me
So here's to me doing whatever the hell I want

'Cause I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Somebody drink one with me
Oh, 'cause I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach

I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess I can't control the Spring Break side of me
A ride home from my boys now is all I need

'Cause I just lost the sand that I brought to the
Yeah I lost the sand that I brought to the
Yes I've lost the sand that I brought to the beach''''''''''''''''''''''
