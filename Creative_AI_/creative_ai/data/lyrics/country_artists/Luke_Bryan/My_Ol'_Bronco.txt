Ain't no doors and no windows
Just a roll bar and a radio
If it rains you're gonna get wet
But that old 302 ain't let me down yet
It's a cut out picture of the '70s
When everything felt so free

It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a back road
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's 3 on the tree and geared down for going slow

My Ol' Bronco!

I flipped it over up on Arno Hill
Turned it back over and fixed the grill
And you know where I've been by that old oil spot
Most times it's in a beach bar parking lot

No, it ain't hard to pick me out
'Cause it's the only one in this town

It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a back road
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's 3 on the tree and geared down for going slow
Know I won't ever let her go
My Ol' Bronco, my Ol' Bronco

Yeah, it's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a back road
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's 3 on the tree and geared down for going slow

No, I ain't gonna ever let her go
My Ol' Bronco, my Ol' Bronco''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
