Bandit was a black lab, Daddy brought home
He said, "son he's yours from now on"
Bandit looked at me and he cocked his head
Slept at night on the foot of my bed
All that year, I can see him still
Chasing after me, nipping at my heels
Down to the bus stop, my new best friend
Still waiting right there when I got home again

And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
I guess I just didn't know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old

He was my sidekick through thick and thin
And he'd bark at my fish when I'd reel 'em in
Summers came and went and we grew like weeds
And I don't know if I raised him or he raised me

And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
How was I supposed to know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old

He was fourteen when I left for Tennessee
And he came down the front porch steps a little slow
I got down to hug his neck
Said "you take care of Mom and Dad, 'til I get home"
"And be a good boy"
"Now you be a good boy"

And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
God I wish I didn't know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old''''''''''''''''
