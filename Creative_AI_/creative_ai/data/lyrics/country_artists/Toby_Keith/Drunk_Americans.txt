We ain't East, we ain't West, we ain't left, we ain't right
We ain't black, we ain't white, we just came here to drink
We're all mud flaps and 'burbans, all ball caps and turbans
All prom queens and strippers, we're the whole kitchen sink
And in here, were the same, everyone knows your name

We just raise up our glass, we don't give a rat's ass
If you're a Democrat or Republican
We're happy to be here and that you can see
We're just all drunk Americans

We ain't second ex-wives, we ain't cowboys or redskins,
Ain't preachers or kingpins, we're just having fun
We're all suits and blue collars, short orders, long haulers
Paper and plastic, too old and too young
CEO's, GED's, DUI's, FBI's, BHD's

And we raise up our glass, we don't give a rat's ass
If your belly's too fat or your wallet's too thin
We're happy to be here and that you can see
We're just all drunk Americans

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la-a
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la-a
All drunk Americans

We've been in, we've been out, we've been cool, we've been weird
Thank God we're still here, in the land of the free
And we all sing it wrong but we all sing a-long
Sing a-long!

We just raise up our glass, we don't give a rats ass
If you're a Democrat or republican
We're happy to be here and that you can see
We're just all drunk Americans
In these neon lights, we're all stars, we're all stripes
And we're all drunk Americans''''''''''''''''''''''
