I've been cussed and I've been kicked out
Slapped in the head and I've been run out
Told to grab my hat and take off walkin'
Right now we get along real well
Walkin' in this cheap motel
Girl, what if that's just the whiskey talkin'?

Yeah, I'm givin' you fair warnin'
Here's your chance to walk away
From now until the mornin'
Don't believe a word I say
Yeah, if I don't wake up beside you
It don't mean I didn't like you
All it means is I've had time to sober up
Girl, every time I drink I fall in love

First beer and I'm warmin' up
Talkin' all that flirty stuff
A few more, I become a line dance teacher
A six pack and I don't care
A twelve pack, you don't stand a prayer
If I start doin' shots, just call the preacher

Yeah, I'm givin' you fair warnin'
Here's your chance to walk away
From now until the mornin'
Don't believe a word I say
Yeah, if I don't wake up beside you
It don't mean I didn't like you
All it means is I've had time to sober up
Girl, every time I drink I fall in love

Every time I drink I start to think
There's somethin' lower
Than this head here on my shoulder
I become a birddog when that
Buzz starts takin' over
And I'm a redneck cassanova

Oh, yeah!

Yeah, I'm givin' you fair warnin'
Here's your chance to walk away
From now until the mornin'
Don't believe a word I say
Yeah, if I don't wake beside you
It don't mean I didn't like you
All it means is I've had time sober up
Girl, every time I drink I fall in love
Yeah, every time I drink I fall in love''''''''''''''''''
