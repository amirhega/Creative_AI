Long distance information, give me Memphis Tennessee
Help me find the party trying to get in touch with me
She did not leave her number, but I know who placed the call
My uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information, get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd call me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge

Last time I saw Marie she was waving me good-bye
She had hurry home drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
And broke apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee

Help me, information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss that girl and all the fun we had
Marie was only six years old, information please
Try to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee
