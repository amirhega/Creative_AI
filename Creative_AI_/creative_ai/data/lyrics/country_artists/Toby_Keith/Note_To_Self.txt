Note to self: better call
She'll be mad as hell if I know her at all
'Cause today's her birthday an' I almost forgot
Note to self: I better not

Note to self: on my way home
Don't forget the roses an' Dom Perignon
You know how she loves a great big surprise
Note to self: you're skating on thin ice

Mmm, I ain't gonna screw it up this time
Mmm, I'm gonna really make her proud she's mine

Note to self: remember when
You use to light her up when you walked in
An' she stole your breath away: that's the way it was
Everytime you kissed her an' she still does, mmm

Mmm, I ain't gonna mess it up this time
Mmm, I'm gonna really make her proud she's mine

Turnin' down the street, I'm pullin' in the drive
Door ain't locked, so I step inside
She ain't here to greet me, so what's goin' on?
Note self: she's already gone

Mmmm, gone
Mmmm, gone
Mmmm, I guess I really messed it up this time''''''''''''''''''''''
