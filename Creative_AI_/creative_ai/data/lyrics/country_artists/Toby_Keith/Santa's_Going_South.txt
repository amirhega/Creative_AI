It's freezin' in Chicago
Snowin' in Toronto,
Manhattan ain't too happy baby
It's pourin' rain in San Francisco

Ain't gonna be no white Christmas
Ain't gonna be no reindeer
Ain't gonna be no sleigh bells ringing
Not around here

I'm packing my tank tops
My board shorts and my flip flops
I take the first class non-stop
Down Mexico way.

Yeah, cause Santa's going south for Christmas
Santa's going south this year, yeah yeah yeah
I said Santa's going south for Christmas (this Christmas)
And he won't be back till summer's here.

I'm talkin' 'bout jet-skis,
Margaritas and palm trees
Now get me out of this deep freeze
I need eighty five degrees

Yeah, I'm packing my tank tops
My board shorts and my flippity flops
I take the first class non-stop
Down Mexico way.

Yeah, Santa's going south for Christmas
Santa's going south this year, yeah yeah yeah
I said Santa's going south for Christmas (this Christmas)
And he won't be back till summer's here.

Now Santa's gettin' old, I can't take this much cold (Brrrr!)

I'm packing my old guitar
My board shorts and my good cigar
First class like a rockstar
Down Mexico way.

Yeah, now Santa's going south for Christmas
I said Santa's going south this year, yeah yeah yeah
Santa's going south for Christmas (this Christmas)
And I won't be back till summer's here.
I'm tellin' you what
I said I ain't comin' back till summer's here, baby
I said I ain't comin' back till summer's here.

Merry Christmas everybody!
Feliz Navidad!''''''''''''''''''''''''
