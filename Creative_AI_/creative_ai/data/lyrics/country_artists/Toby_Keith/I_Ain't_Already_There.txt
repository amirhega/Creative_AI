She called me on the 'phone and said:
"C'mon, get on the plane tonight, pronto"
So just like every time when Kimo Sabi cried for help
Here come Tonto
I guess she run her lover off again
An' I can't believe how long it's been
I had my fingers runnin' through her hair
Only bad thing about it: I ain't already there

Baby, I just landed, grabbed my bag an' hopped a cab
An' I'm comin' solo
Light a candle, fill a tub, put on some music that you love
An' I'll bring the mojo
Yeah, the cabbie said that he'd drive like hell
Keep promise me a pony-tail
An' Baby Vicky's secret underwear
Only bad thing about it: I ain't already there

Now it's been real an' it's been fun
Another notch carved in her gun: repetition
You know the funny thing when you play her game
What you thought would change just stays the same: eviction
I'd be on this plane to Illinois
She'd be locked down with some pretty boy
When we touched down in Chicago at O'Hare
Only bad thing about it is I ain't already there, oh no
Only bad thing about it: I ain't already there

Already there
I ain't already there
Already there'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
