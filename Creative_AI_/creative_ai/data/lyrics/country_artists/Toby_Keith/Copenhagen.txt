Copenhagen
It makes me feel so good
Copenhagen
The way I know it should
I put a lil' chew in my mouth
Go spittin' and a slobberin' all around the house
That Copenhagen it makes me feel so good
Well I took a chew just the other night
It made me feel just fine
I grabbed my honey baby and I pinched her ol' behind
She said you better spit out that chewing terbaccer
If you wanna kiss me on the big ol' smacker
That Copenhagen
It makes me feel so good
Copenhagen
It makes me feel so good
Copenhagen
The way I know it should
I put a lil' chew in my mouth
Go hackin' and a gaggin' all around the house
That Copenhagen it makes me feel so good
Well I was sitting in a bar room when I took a lil' dip
Drinkin' beer and talkin' but I had no place to spit
So I spit a stream out on the floor
The bouncer flung me out the door
That Copenhagen it makes me feel so good
Copenhagen
It makes me feel so good
Copenhagen
The way I know it should
I put a lil' chew in my mouth
Go spittin' and a slobberin' all around the house
That Copenhagen it makes me feel so good
Well it's a cure-all too
Cures fits, warts, freckles, coughs, colds, runny nose
Guaranteed not rip, run or snag
Make conception a wonder and childbirth a pleasure
That's Copenhagen
Copenhagen it makes me feel so good yeah''''''''''''''''''
