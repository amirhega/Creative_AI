Twister came through our home town
And tore alot of peoples houses down
Always happens in the spring
But this time missed everything.
Put the band back on the road
Still got alot of wild seeds to sow
LB prayed and Michael cried
It was the first time without you
By my side.

Stage goes up, stage goes down
Busses roll through another town
Words to write and gigs to play
And you'll always be a song away
Your bass is there where you used to stand
And even though we got a killer band
Still look up in the middle of a song
And realize Chuckie's gone.
Chuckie's gone

Never got to say goodbye
And thank you for the times I cried and laughed.
You were quicker than the rest
Fastest gun slinger in the West
I hope you find peace from your pain
Must of been like a hurricane.
So fly away with all our love
Sure wish you didn't need that stuff.

Stage goes up Stage goes down
Busses roll through another town
Words to write and gigs to play
And you'll always be a song away.
Your bass is there where you used to stand
And even though we got a killer band
Still look up in the middle of a song
And realize Chuckie's gone.
Chuckie's gone''''''''''''''''''''''''
