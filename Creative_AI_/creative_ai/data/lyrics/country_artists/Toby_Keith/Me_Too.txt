If I send you roses, for no reason at all.
If out of the blue, I stop and give you a call.
Once in a while, it's breakfast in bed.
And then pull the covers back up over our head.
If I call in sick, just to stay home with you.
I want you to know, I do what I do.
It's my way of saying, what I can't express.
But I want you to know, Girl I'm doing my best.

Ooh I'm just a man, that's the way I was made.
I'm not too good at saying, what you need me to say.
It's always right there on the tip of my tongue.
It might go unsaid, but it won't go undone.
So when those three little words come so easy to you.
I hope you know what I mean when I say...
Me too

If you should wake up, and catch me watching you sleep.
And I break the silence, by kissing your cheek.
If I whisper something you don't understand.
Don't make me repeat it, I don't know if I can.

Ooh I'm just a man, that's the way I was made.
I'm not too good at saying, what you need me to say.
It's always right there on the tip of my tongue.
It might go unsaid, but it won't go undone.
So when those three little words come so easy to you.
I hope you know what I mean when I say...
Me too...

Me too... Me too...
Ooh I hope you know what I mean when I say...
Meee tooooooo
Me too''''''''''''''''
