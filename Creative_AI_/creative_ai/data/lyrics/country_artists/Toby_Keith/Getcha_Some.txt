Well boy meets girl and it's a good bet
Girls gonna play a little hard to get
But they both got the same thing on their mind
Ain't that the way that the world goes round
Don't it get you up get you down
It gets you walking around with a flashlight trying to find
Love

Ooh gotta getcha some, gotta getcha some
Gotta getcha some
Ooh gotta getcha some
Love!

Then boy sees girl with another guy
What he wouldn't give just to catch her eye 'cause man
She is so hot
But you can't compete with a superstar
He's got a big old house and a little red car
And what I need is the one thing you ain't got
Money!

Ooh gotta getcha some, gotta getcha some
Gotta getcha some
Ooh gotta getcha some
Money!

Ooh gotta getcha some, gotta getcha some
Gotta getcha some
Ooh gotta getcha some
Yeah!

Then god smiles down from up above
The money rolls in and they fall in love
From the outside looking in it's a dream come true
But as time goes by something turns up missing
There's not enough hugging and not enough kissing
Before too long they better do what they gotta do
You know!

Ooh gotta getcha some, gotta getcha some
Gotta getcha some
Ooh gotta getcha some
Babies!

Ooh gotta getcha some, gotta getcha some
Gotta getcha some
Ooh gotta getcha some
Yeah!

You know curtain climbers, and rugrats, and tricycle motors
It don't matter what you call em'
You gotta have a whole house full of em'
Ain't nothing in the world like youngins
Getcha some!''''''''''''''''''
