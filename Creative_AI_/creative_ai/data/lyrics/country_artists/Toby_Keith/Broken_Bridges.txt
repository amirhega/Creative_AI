There are bridges on lifes highway
But we never see them there
Some cross troubled waters
Some don't go nowhere

Some you wouldn't step on if your tryin' to save your soul
One comes with a keeper
When it's time to pay the toll

Some aren't meant to last forever
Some are made of stone
Some are meant to cross together
Some you go alone

Some the slightest wind can send in crashing to the ground
I set a bridge on fire
But I could not burn it down

Here I am prayin' for forgiveness
And I can see you
Standin' on the other side
And here I go (here I go)
And baby it's a heavy load (it's a heavy load)
I have crossed some broken bridges in my time

Now here I am (now here I am)
Prayin' for forgiveness (Prayin' for forgiveness)
I can see you (Oh I can see you)
Standin' on the other side (standin' on the other side)
Here I go (Now here I go)
And buddy it's a heavy load (and baby it's a heavy load)
But, I have crossed some broken bridges in my time (crossed some broken bridges in my time)

Yes I have crossed some broken bridges in my time...''''''''''''''''''
