I got it bad, I got it blue.
I got it sad: I ain't got you.
I did you wrong: you got the right.
Look what I had: I got it bad.

Gone and left me lonely,
Cryin' like a fool.
I just can't believe,
Love could be so cruel.

I got it bad, I got it blue.
I got it sad: I ain't got you.
I did you wrong: you got the right.
Look what I had: I got it bad.

I know, someday,
I'll get on my feet again.
I'll get over you,
But, baby, until then.

I got it bad, I got it blue.
I got it sad: I ain't got you.
I did you wrong: you got the right.
Look what I had: I got it bad.
Look what I had: I got it bad.''''''''''''''''''
