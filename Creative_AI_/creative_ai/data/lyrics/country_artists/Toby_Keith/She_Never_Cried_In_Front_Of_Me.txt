It's 7:35
She's someone else's wife
And I can get on with my life
And that thrills me
She married him today
Her daddy gave the bride away
I heard a tear rolled down her face
And that kills me
'Cause now I, can see why
She's finally crying

How was I supposed to know
She was slowly lettin' go
If I was puttin' her through hell
Hell - I couldn't tell
She could've given me a sign
And opened up my eyes
How was I supposed to see
She never cried in front of me

Yeah maybe I might've changed
It's hard for me to say
But the story's still the same
And it's a sad one
And I'll always believe
If she ever did cry for me
They were tears that you can't see
You know the bad ones
And now I, can see why
She's finally crying

How was I supposed to know
She was slowly lettin' go
If I was puttin' her through hell
Hell - I couldn't tell
She could've given me a sign
And opened up my eyes
How was I supposed to see
She never cried in front of me

Without a doubt, I know now
How it outta be
'Cause she's gone and it's wrong
And it bothers me
Tomorrow I'll still be asking myself

How was I supposed to know
She was slowly lettin' go
If I was puttin' her through hell
Hell - I couldn't tell
She could've given me a sign
And opened up my eyes
How was I supposed to see

How was I supposed to see
She never cried in front of me
Well - I couldn't tell''''''''''''''''''''
