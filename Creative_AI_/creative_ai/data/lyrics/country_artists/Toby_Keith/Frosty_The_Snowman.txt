Frosty the Snowman, was a jolly happy soul,
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made of coal.
Frosty the Snowman, is a fairytale, they say.
He was made of snow, but the children know he came to life one day.
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found,
For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around!
Oh, Frosty, the Snowman, was alive as he could be;
And the children say he could laugh and play,
Just the same as you and me.

Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump,
Look at Frosty go.
Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump,
Over the hills of snow.

Frosty the Snowman, knew the sun was hot that day,
So he said, "Let's run, and we'll have some fun now, before I melt away."
Down to the village, with a broomstick in his hand,
Running here and there, all around the square,
Sayin', "Catch me if you can."
He led them down the streets of town, right to the traffic cop;
And only paused a moment, when he heard him holler, "Stop!"
For Frosty, the Snowman, had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye, sayin' "Don't cry, I'll be back again some day."''''''''''''''''
