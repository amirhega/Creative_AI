I'm floating in my boat
Not the one I used to fish in
But the boat I sit in wishin'
I was still floating on my fishing boat
And I'm out here on this river
Really it's just a creek
But it's a river when I drink
So I'm drinking on my river boat

I could sail to the ocean
If the wind would come and get me
But I ain't goin' nowhere quickly
I'm just a drunkin' sailor, waiting on a gale
With a drink in my hand and a sailboat for sale

Aye, aye

An old pirate sold me on a
We traded straight across
The boat I thought I wanted
For the boat I hate I lost
She'll sing when that wind whistles
When it doesn't, well she don't
Just ask that old pirate
That's floatin' on my river boat

I could sail to the ocean
If the wind would come and get me
But I ain't goin' nowhere quickly
I'm just a drunkin' sailor, waiting on a gale
With a drink in my hand and a sailboat for sale

Never make a handshake deal while sharing someone bottle
Never buy a boat son that doesn't have a throttle

Aye, aye

I could sail to the ocean
If the wind would come and get me
But I ain't goin' nowhere quickly
I'm just a drunkin' sailor, waiting on a gale
With a drink in my hand and a sailboat for sale

I got a sailboat for sale

Aye, aye''''''''''''''''''
