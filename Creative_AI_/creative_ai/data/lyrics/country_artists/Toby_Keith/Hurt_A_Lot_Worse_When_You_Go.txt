Go on and call me up
Tell me you made a grave mistake
You know I never once turned you away
Bad as I hate to say
I know how good it's gonna be
Just for a night I lay you down by me
And you lie, like you won't say goodbye
Like you do every time

Come here and kiss me and act like you miss me
Make me believe we're together
Come here and hold me and baby control me
Touch me like you'll be here forever
You never cut me deep enough to tell you "no"
Tell me you love me, I'll hurt a lot worse when you go

I'm not what you want 
No I'm not ever gonna be
More than someone you come to in need
And you lie, like you won't say goodbye
Like you do every time

Come here and kiss me and act like you miss me
Make me believe we're together
Come here and hold me and baby control me
Touch me like you'll be here forever
You never cut me deep enough to tell you "no"
Tell me you love me, I'll hurt a lot worse when you go
You never cut me deep enough to tell you "no"'''''''''''''''''''''
