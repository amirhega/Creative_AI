I'm a piece of work, I'm iron and lace
I'm shy, right up there in your face
I'm all dumbfounded, stubborn as an ass
Sharp as an arrow in a pile of glass
I'm a sweetheart, genius, restless jerk
Lord have mercy, I'm a piece of work

Well, the lord made me on a long thin limb
Made sure I'd remember him
Or her in the middle of a long, dark night
Creation crazy, death sheet white
Made in the image of a lion shocked lamb
I am who the hell I am
Ever better, bad to worse
Down to the letter I'm a piece of work

I'm a piece of work, I'm an angel's fiend
Bathed in lavender and gasoline
Scared brave, shallow in an ink black well
Lightly browned in the fires of hell
Wicked, holy, full on fake
Best known for my big mistake
I'm Zen wise, peaceful, gone berserk
Good god almighty I'm a piece of work

I'm a dreadful sight and I just don't care
Spent all morning pulling out my hair
I woke at dawn with a crazy spin
Half the day trying to glue back in
Mother, bloody mary, please
Wipe that smile right off your knees
I'm the CEO of the mailroom clerks
Lord have mercy, what a piece of work

I'm a piece of work, I'm a lovesick boy
Cloth cap, caviar and corduroy
All over the map, just a-lost in space
With a filthy mind and a choirboy's face
Heels up, head down, straight on through
Watch out, woman I'm-a get to you
I'm a gladiator with a mind to irk
Good god almighty I'm a piece of work
I'm a piece of work
I'm a piece of work
I'm a piece of work''''''''''''''''
