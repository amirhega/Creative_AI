She said, "What makes you think you could be my one and only?
How do I know you just won't leave me lonely?
I been lookin' for someone to call mine."
Girl, if I ain't it, I'm a pretty good waste of time

Hey, I ain't bad, I do all right
Dig a ditch or dig on me tonight
I'm good for a laugh, good for a beer
Baby, I'm good till good gets here

I don't know what tomorrow holds but I can hold you now
You can miss a lot of livin', chasin' love around
Baby, I'm all yours if you want me
Come and get me, I'll give it a go
Baby, if you let me

I ain't bad, I do all right
Dig a ditch or dig on me tonight
I'm good for a laugh, good for a beer
Baby, I'm good till good gets here

Now if you need a simpler man
I probably ain't that guy
But baby, I can save your day
Till he comes by and by

I ain't bad, I do all right
Dig a ditch or dig on me tonight
I'm good for a laugh, good for a beer
Baby, I'm good till good gets here

I ain't bad, I do all right
Dig a ditch or dig on me tonight
I'm good for a laugh, good for a beer
Baby, I'm good till good gets here''''''''''''''''''
