I got a good bull rope
I got a brand new bell
I got a hot-rod pickup truck, she can really set sail
Pushing that red line, gotta make that show
Gonna meet my buddies at the rodeo

I just drew myself a mean old bull
We're all smellin' money, 'cause the jackpot's full
He's got fire in his belly, and he turns back quick
Son, this big devil got a bag of tricks

Gimme eight more seconds
Gimme one more shot
Gimme hell below, but gimme strength on top
Gotta be crazy, gotta be insane
To hitch your wagon to a hurricane

I'm gonna wrap my rope around my glove real tight
I'm dropping my hooks down, I'm ready to ride
Say a little prayer, give my nod and go
Stay clean in the middle till I hear that whistle blow

Gimme eight more seconds
Gimme one more shot
Gimme hell below, but gimme strength on top
Gotta be crazy, gotta be insane
To Hitch your wagon to a hurricane

Yeah, hitch your wagon to a hurricane''''''''''''''''''
