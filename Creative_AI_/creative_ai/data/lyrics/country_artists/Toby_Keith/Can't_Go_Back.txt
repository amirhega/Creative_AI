Can't go back, can't go home
Though you've been told
Anything goes when everything's gone
You risk it all
And hope you might find
Something inside, that something inside
Will ease your trouble mind

I swore I'd never do this anymore
It's always the heartache behind each door
When you try to fix a life that's shattered as mine
There's always a few little pieces you can't find
