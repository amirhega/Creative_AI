Yeah Yeah
That's right
We talk about your work
How your boss is a jerk
We talk about your church
And your head when it hurts
We talk about the troubles you been having with your brother
About your daddy and your mother
And your crazy ex-lover

We talk about your friends
And the places that you've been
We talk about your skin and the dimples on your chin
The polish on your toes and the run in your hose
And God knows we're gonna talk about your clothes

You know talking about you makes me smile
But every once in a while

I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one
Oh my me my
What I think
What I like
What I know
What I want
What I see
I like talking about you you you you usually
But occasionally 
I wanna talk about me
I wanna talk about me

We talk about your dreams
And we talk about your schemes
Your high school team and your moisturizing cream
We talk about your nana up in Munci, Indiana
We talk about your grandmaw down in Alabama

We talk about your guys
Of every shape and size
The ones that you despise and the ones you idolize
We talk about your heart bout your brain and your smarts
And your medical charts
And when you start

You know talking about you makes me grin
But every now and then

I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one
Oh my me my
What I think
What I like
What I know
What I want
What I see
I like talking about you you you you usually
But occasionally 
I wanna talk about me
I wanna talk about me

I wanna talk about me
I wanna talk about me
Me me me me me 
I wanna talk about me
Me me me me me
You you you you you you you you you you you you you
I wanna talk about me

I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one
Oh my me my
What I think
What I like
What I know
What I want
What I see
I like talking about you you you you usually
But occasionally 
I wanna talk about me
I wanna talk about me
I wanna talk about me
I wanna talk about me
I wanna talk about me
I wanna talk about me''''''''''''''''
