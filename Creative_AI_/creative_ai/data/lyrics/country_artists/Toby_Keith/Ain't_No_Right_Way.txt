Seven in the mornin'
She'd have to make a choice
Precious baby girl
Or a bouncin' baby boy
She could either keep it
Or give that child away
So she quit school that mornin'
An' became a Mom that day

Ain't no right way to do the wrong thing
You can justify but it's still black an' white
Paint it any shade but it won't change
Ain't no right way to do the wrong thing

News came on my TV
A mother cried an' said
That her son was fightin' for his life
'Cause her husband lost his head
He might have been a problem child
But if that boy were mine
I wouldn't beat him half to death
Tryin' to make him walk the line

Ain't no right way to do the wrong thing
You can justify but it's still black an' white
Paint it any shade but it won't change
Ain't no right way to do the wrong thing

Now empowered politicians
Tryin' to pass a law
They won't let our children pray
For the better of us all
An' if God blessed America
How could someone vote
To take prayer from our classrooms
Right when we need prayer the most

Ain't no right way to do the wrong thing
You can justify but it's still black an' white
Paint it any shade but it won't change
Ain't no right way to do the wrong thing
To do the wrong thing'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
