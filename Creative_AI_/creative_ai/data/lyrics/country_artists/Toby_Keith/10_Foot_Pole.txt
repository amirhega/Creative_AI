We were 'bout as tight as we could be
Cooked peas in a pot, thick as thieves
Never saw me without her
Well, so much for the way things were
We blew up, she blew by
I ain't seen her since it all went south
She don't call, she don't swing by
She don't even know if I'm dead or alive

We were burnin' it up like Bonnie and Clyde
Takin' on the world, baby, side by side
Born to be together
And lettin' the good times roll
She changed her tune while I was busy strummin'
We got so close I didn't see it comin'
The hot time in this old town sure turned cold
Hell, now I couldn't touch her with a ten foot pole

Saw her momma at the store, she wouldn't speak
And her danged ol' daddy burned a hole through me
You won't know it if you seen us at the mall
That I was gonna be their son-in-law
It's almost like I never met her
She can write me off if it makes her feel better
Our love is dead but I didn't die
You can't take back that five year ride

We were burnin' it up like Bonnie and Clyde
Takin' on the world, baby, side by side
Born to be together
And lettin' the good times roll
She changed her tune while I was busy strummin'
We got so close I didn't see it comin'
The hot tme in this old town sure turned cold
Hell, now I couldn't touch her with a ten foot pole

We were burnin' it up
Like Bonnie and Clyde
Takin' on the world
Side by side
She changed her tune while I was busy strummin'
We got so close I didn't see it comin'
The hot time in this old town sure turned cold
Hell, now I couldn't touch her with a ten foot pole''''''''''''''''''
