He was 25
She was 28
He was home-grown country
She'd just pulled off the interstate

She bought a Dr. Pepper
Ten dollars worth of gas
She was obviously lost
But too afraid to ask directions

So he offered her a smile
And a stick of beachnut gum
Said, "Where you headed to girl?
Where you comin' from?"

She said, "New Orleans
But that's another story
New Orleans
But that's another time,
That's another town,
That's another life"

First she stayed a day
Then she stayed a week
A couple months later they were
Livin' on his parents' street
He worked the station
She worked the store
And then they had a baby
And then they had one more, little Jessie
When she dropped the kids off
At the mothers' day out
All the ladies had their questions
But knew not to ask about

New Orleans
'Cause that's another story
New Orleans
That's another time,
That's another town,
That's another life

Wednesday night supper
At the first baptist church
A stranger standing in the doorway
As she's passing out dessert
He said, "Go and pack your bags
'Cause I'm here to take you home
We're going back to Louisiana
Woman I ain't gonna go without you"

There's a few defining moments
In every person's life
When you know what you've done wrong
And you know what you've done right

Before the congregation
Her husband and her kids
She said, "How dare you even speak to me
After everything you did in

New Orleans
But that's another story
New Orleans
But that's another time,
That's another town,
That's another life

Oh that's another time...
That's another town...
That's another life...''''''''''''''''''
