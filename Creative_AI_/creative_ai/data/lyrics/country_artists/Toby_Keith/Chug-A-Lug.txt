Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
Make you wanna holler hidey-hoe
Burns your tummy, don't you know?
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug

Grape wine in a mason jar
Homemade and brought to school
By a friend of mine in my class
Me and him and this other fool

Decided that we'll drink up what's left
Chug-a-lug, so I helped ourselves
First time for everything
Mmm, my ears still ring

Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
Make you wanna holler hidey-hoe
Burns your tummy, don't you know?
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug

Four H and an F F A
On the field trip to the farm
Me and friends sneaked off behind
To this big old barn

Where we uncovered a
Covered up moonshine still
And we thought we drank our fill
I swallowed it with a smile
Brr, and run ten mile

Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
Make you wanna holler hidey-hoe
Burns your tummy, don't you know?
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug

Jukebox and sawdust floor
Somthin' like I ain't never seen
Hell, I'm just goin' on 15
But with the help of my fanaglein' uncle

I get snuck in
For my first taste of sin
I said let me have a big old sip
Brr, I done a double back flip

Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
Make you wanna holler hidey-hoe
Burns your tummy, don't you know?
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug''''''''''''''''
