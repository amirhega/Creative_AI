He said son you've no future, pack up and go with me.

Well the first place we landed was a base called Balad. 
They convoyed our asses to a 10 acre faub. 
With my boots and my cover and an old M-16, two bottle of water and a cold MRE.

Oh, you meet lots of new friends and you're sure to get paid. 
We'll show you the world and we'll teach you a trade. 
It's not a job, it's an adventure. 
Oh yes sir I got that, but you never told me I'd get my ass shot at.

The first night in combat we went on patrol. 
The ambushed our convoy and we chased the assholes. 
We found them all hidin' in the water ditches.

Walked in on my buddy with a female marine.
Ugliest woman that you've ever seen. 
He said why are you laughin', you've got lots of nerve. 
Over here in the desert, we grade on the curve.

Oh, you meet lots of new friends and you're sure to get paid.
