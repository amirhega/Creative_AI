Come on baby lay back down
You don't have to leave right now
Anything you got downtown can wait

I love those high heeled shoes
Everything looks good on you
You make it look brand new every day

I got it, in a bad way
I wanna kiss your sweet face
And lay like this forever
I need you to need me
Complete my world
I got it for you, girl

Baby, I can hear your breath
Whisper softly on my chest
I can feel your sweat all over me
Sheets stuck to your skin
Give me that 'want to' grin 
Baby, I 'want to' again

I got it, in a bad way
I wanna kiss your sweet face
And lay like this forever
I need you to need me
Complete my world
I got it for you, girl

Everything you've dreamed on
Just lay right here and sleep on
Never gonna have to want again
I got it for you girl

I need you to need me
Complete my world
I've got it for you'''''''''''''''''''''
