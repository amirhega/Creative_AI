They used to call me lightening; I was always quick to strike
Had everything I own in the saddles on my back
I had a reputation for never stayin' very long
Just like a wild and restless drifter like a cowboy in a song

I met a dark haired beauty where they laid the whiskey down
In southern Arizona in a little border town
She had to dance for money in that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox; played that girl a tune, yeah

Never see it comin'; it just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul and that fire in her eyes
That makes you come together like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and the bullets in the gun, yeah

She was sittin' on my lap; we still had shots to kill
When a man pulled up who owned the bar in a Cadillac Deville
Grabbed her by her raven hair and threw her in the floor
Said "no free rides for the cowboys; that ain't what I pay you for," no

She jumped up and grabbed my pistol, stuck it in the fat man's back
Said open up the safe and put your money in the sack
Tied his hands behind him and put a blindfold on his eyes
If you're dumb enough to chase us, man, you're dumb enough to die

Never see it comin'; it just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul and that fire in her eyes
That makes you come together like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and the bullets in the gun, yeah

We rode across the border, down into Mexico
When you're runnin' from the law, ain't that where everybody goes?
We came to a town with a name I couldn't spell
She gave me what I came for in that Mexican motel

I woke up to sirens and the sound of runnin' feet
There were 50 Federales locked and loaded in the street
She grabbed my 44; I grabbed the money in the sack
She kissed me for the last time and we headed out the back

Every gun was on us and every heartbeat poundin'
There's only one thing left to do when they got you all surrounded
She fired that old pistol but we didn't stand a prayer
Money hit the gravel; bullets filled the air, yeah

Never see it comin'; it just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul and that fire in her eyes
That makes you come together like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and the bullets in the gun, yeah

Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun.''''''''''''''''
