I woke up this morning in the county jail
My head was splitting and my face was pale
Pissed off psycho in the bed next to me
It dawned on me I would never be free

I got the DUI blues 
I had too much booze
And got behind the wheel of my car
Oh Lord the blue light shining behind me

My girlfriend dumped me and I was feeling down
Had to see people so I headed downtown
A few too many and was feeling frisky
God knows I never meant to drink all that whisky 

I got the DUI blues 
I had too much booze
And got behind the wheel of my car
Oh Lord the blue light shining behind me

I had too much booze 
Should never have gone to that god dam bar
Oh Lord the blue light shining behind me

My job is going down the drain 
God help me things will never be the same
I refused to blow but with lawyers and jail time
My existence ain't worth a dime 

I got the DUI blues
I had to much booze 
I never meant to go that far
Oh Lord the blue light shining behind me''''''''''''''''
