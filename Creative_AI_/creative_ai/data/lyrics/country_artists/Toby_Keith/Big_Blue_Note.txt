See that big blue note,
Over there on the counter?
You don't wanna read that thing, man,
It's a real get-you-downer.
But don't you dare say nothin' else,
Bad about her: she's gone.

No, no, no, no, don't, don't throw it away,
'Cause tonight, I might need it.
It gets real lonely around here at night some times,
An' I have to read read it.
Besides, you can show it to the boys down town,
They won't believe that she's gone.

There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted.
All the man that she'll ever need.
I come home to find, just like that, she's up an' vanished.
An' the only thing she left behind for me:

Is this big blue note,
Folded up in my pocket.
Yeah, don't laugh: it's been two months;
I still got it.
Sometimes I have to read the sucker twice,
Just to make sure I ain't forgot that she's gone.

You know, my psychiatrist said:
"Tell me, what do you see,
"When you look at these inkspots,
"Of, er, reds, yellows an' greens?"
You know, I looked at 'em all, 
But they all looked to me like big blue notes.

There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted.
All the man that she'll ever need.
I come home to find, just like that, she's up an' vanished.
An' the only thing that's left to do for me:

Is stand high on this cliff,
Overlooking the sea.
With my big blue notepaper aeroplane,
That I just set free.
An' I'm gonna wait here a few more minutes,
An' if it don't come back to me:
You guessed it: she's gone.

Crash landing.
Bye bye, baby.''''''''''''''''
