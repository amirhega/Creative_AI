Well, boy meets girl and it's a good bet
Girls gonna play a little hard to get
But they both got the same thing on their mind

Ain't that the way that the world goes 'round
Don't it get you up, get you down
It gets you walking around
With a flashlight trying to find love

Ooh, gotta getcha some, gotta getcha some
Gotta getcha some, ooh, gotta getcha some love
Ooh, gotta getcha some, gotta getcha some
Gotta getcha some, ooh, gotta getcha some, yeah

Then boy sees girl with another guy
What he wouldn't give just to catch her eye
'Cause man she is so hot

Course you can't compete with a superstar
He's got a big old house and little red car
And what need is the one thing you don't have money

Ooh, gotta getcha some, gotta getcha some
Gotta getcha some, ooh, gotta getcha some money
Ooh, gotta getcha some, gotta getcha some
Gotta getcha some, ooh, gotta getcha some, yeah

Then God smiles down from up above
The money rolls in and they fall in love
From the outside looking in it's a dream come true

But as time goes by something turns up missing
There's not enough hugging and not enough kissing
Before to long they better do what they gotta do, you know

Ooh, gotta getcha some, gotta getcha some
Gotta getcha some, ooh, gotta getcha some babies
Ooh, gotta getcha some, gotta getcha some
Gotta getcha some, ooh, gotta getcha some, yeah

You know curtain climbers
And rugrats, and tricycle motors
It don't matter what you call 'em
You gotta have a whole house full of 'em
Ain't nothing in the world like youngins getcha some''''''''''''''''
