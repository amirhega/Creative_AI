She looked like a lawyer's daughter,
Fresh out of the Ivy League,
Yeah and I look like the devil's prodigal son,
When she sat down next to me,
Well I told her about my ol' bird dog,
She mentioned her pretty friends,
I said I'd sure like to meet your family some time,
And she just laughed at me and said.

She said I wouldn't take you home to Momma,
You're a diamond in the rough,
There's just to many things about you,
That my Momma couldn't learn to love,

She said I'm crazy for even talking to you,
But there's something about you I like,
I wouldn't take you home to Momma,
Yeah but Momma ain't home tonight,
All my buddies are green with envy,
As we headed for the parking lot,
Me with that long legged gal on my arm,
Just thinking 'bout you know what,

She said why don't you leave your ragged old pickup,
We'll take my Cadillac,
Next mornin' when I woke up in her big brass bed,
She was begging me to hurry back,

She said I wouldn't take you home to Momma,
You're a diamond in the rough,
There's just to many things about you,
That my Momma couldn't learn to love,

She said you ain't good looking and you ain't real bright,
But there's something about you I like,
I wouldn't take you home to Momma,
Yeah but Momma ain't home tonight,

She said I would not take you home to my Momma,
Yeah but Momma's out of town tonight.'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
