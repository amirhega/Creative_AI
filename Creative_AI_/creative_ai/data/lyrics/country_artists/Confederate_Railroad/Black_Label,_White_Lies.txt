Well I bragged and said I had
A women that loved me too much to get mad
When I stayed out in them neon lights too long

Oh but late last night I was late again
She was moved out when I walked in
And I realized the fool I'd been
Now all I've got to do is fool my friends with

Black Label and white lies sitting round the table telling other guys
How it broke her heart to set me free
Ordered up another round, tell 'em how her tears came down
Try to save some foolish pride with Black Label and white lies

Well I've sat right here too many nights
Seeing that women was wrapped too tight
To come undone unless I's to cut the strings

So I'm buying drinks with this months rent
Trying to look like I'm glad she went
Now I got no woman, I got no sense
But I got everybody here convinced with

Black Label and white lies sitting round the table telling other guys
How it broke her heart to set me free
Ordered up another round, tell 'em how her tears came down
Try to save some foolish pride with Black Label and white lies

Mabelle bring us another round, knowing I never would live this down
So cover up these blues inside here, Black Label and white lies
Yeah, Black Label and white lies''''''''''''''''''
