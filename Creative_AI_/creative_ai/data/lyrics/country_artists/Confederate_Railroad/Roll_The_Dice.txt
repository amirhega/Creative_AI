I was raised where the rivers run wild
I've been a man since I was a child
Born to the blues and bound to survive

I'm living against the cards
Like the next chance is all I got
So go on and roll the dice

Go on, roll the dice
Never once have I ever thought twice
I just lay them down and let them ride

Go on, roll them bones
Aim for the stars and shoot for the moon
Go on, and roll the dice

I lost my heart to a woman in red
I was under her spell I ain't over yet
She turned me loose on a black magic night

I bet my soul to a blue devils dare
Had me some chances but never a prayer
So go on, and roll the dice

Go on, roll the dice
Never once have I ever thought twice
I just lay them down and let them ride

Go on, roll them bones
Aim for the stars and shoot for the moon
Go on, and roll the dice

Go on, roll the dice
Never once have I ever thought twice
I just lay them down and let them ride

Go on, roll them bones
Aim for the stars and shoot for the moon
Go on, and roll the dice

Go on, roll the dice
Never once have I ever thought twice
I just lay them down and let them ride

Go on, roll them bones
Aim for the stars and shoot for the moon
Go on, and roll the dice''''''''''''''''''
