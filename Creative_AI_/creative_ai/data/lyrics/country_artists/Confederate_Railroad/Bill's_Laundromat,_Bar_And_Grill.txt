Well, I was three days short of pullin' out Bridgeport
I was headed down to Houston town
Had my guitar packed in a burlap sack
For escortin' my country sound

I bypassed Jackson, bypassed Memphis
By the time I got to Arkansas
Id-a sold my car and this black guitar
For anything cool and tall

So I pulled up to a neon sign on highway forty-nine
Shut the engine down, took a look around
And then I stepped inside
I asked that bouncer where I was
He said, "Son, you're at Bills"

Honky tonk pickin', line dance kickin'
Razor back stickin', barbecue chicken
Laundromat bar and grill

Well, I saw old Bill sittin' at the bar
With a waitress and change machine
He was dolin' out quarters to a waitress named Starr
When I asked him if I could sing

He said, "Son, go ahead if you brought your guitar"
Then he pointed to the back stage door
He said, "We don't like original material
Unless it's been done before"

Well, I hit the stage like a big wheeled train
Told the crowd, I played the seats
I played the Tennessee Waltz, Kentucky Rain
And the one about the pearly street
That lead guitar was like a chain saw
That fiddle like a power drill at Bill's

Honky tonk pickin', line dance kickin'
Razor back stickin', barbecue chicken
Laundromat bar and grill

Well, in the few short minutes, I was up on stage
Lookin' back at country cowboys face
With a perfect view I was witness to
The destruction of the whole damn place

It was [unverified]
Flyin' out of that dodge saloon
And that mechanical bull was a Houston pull
To the safest place in the room

Well a punch-drunk cowboy showed his wife
That his shirt was soaked in beer
She said, "Calm down, honey, have another light
'Cause we can wash the shirt right here"
Then the whole place stopped to thank me
For bookin' my show at Bill's

Honky tonk pickin', line dance kickin'
Razor back stickin', barbecue chicken
Laundromat bar and grill

At Bill's, honky tonk pickin', line dance kickin'
Razor back stickin', barbecue chicken
Laundromat bar and grill'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
