I'm so glad you finally called
It's been way too long
How's New York and you been getting on?

You say you're prayin' for one whole week
Well, let me just tell you
The weather here's been kind of crazy too

Summer in Dixie, sure been cold
Even when the sun burns hot enough
There'd be tar on the road
Way down in my heart, a north wind blows
Summer in Dixie, sure been cold

Now if Manhattan turns you on
Do what you gotta do
Don't worry how I'll make it without you

I'll just here on the porch
And wait here for the breeze
To whisper your name through the willow trees

Summer in Dixie, it sure been cold
Even when the sun burns hot enough
There'd be tar on the road
Way down in my heart, a north wind blows
Summer in Dixie, sure been cold

You know I'd never
Talk about the weather

Summer in Dixie, sure been cold
Even when the sun burns hot enough
There'd be tar on the road
Way down in my heart, a north wind blows
Summer in Dixie, sure been cold
Summer in Dixie, sure been cold''''''''''''''''''
