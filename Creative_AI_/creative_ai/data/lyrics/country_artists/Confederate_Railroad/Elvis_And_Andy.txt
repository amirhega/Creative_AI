Now bein' from the south,
I never had a doubt,
What kind of girl I'd want.
I'd pick a Georgia peach,
Or a Mississippi queen,
Or a Dallas Debutante.
But a met a little blonde from above and beyond
The Mason-Dixon line,
Now she ain't a dixie dumplin', but let me tell you something
Lord she more than qualifies.

She like Elvis, she likes Andy
She's just as pretty as can be
She's the number one fan
Both Graceland and Mayberry RFD
She ain't a Southern bele, but its hard to tell,
She's got every quality.
She likes Elvis, she like Andy,
So she's fine and dandy with me
(Mucial interlude)

I took her home for Christmas
To try some Soutehrn dishes
My mommas famous for.
But momma through a fit
'Cause she wouldn't eat her grits
It was lookin' like the civil war
I was hopin' like the Devil
That they'd meet up in the middle
But neither one would budge
Then I heard 'em in the kitchen,
Laughin' and a gigglin'
Singin' hunk-a-hunk-a-burnin' love

(Musical Interlude)

No she ain't a Southern Belle, but its hard to tell
She has every quality
She like Elvis, she like Andy
So she's fine and dandy with me

She like Elvis, she like Andy
So she's fine and dandy with me''''''''''''''''''
