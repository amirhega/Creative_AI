Bessie was a lovely child from West Tennessee
Leroy was an outlaw, hard-eyed and mean
One day she saw him starin', and it chilled her to the bone
She knew she had to see that look on a child of her own

'Cause ladies love outlaws
Like babies love stray dogs
Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold
Outlaws touch ladies somewhere deep down in their soul

Linda was a lady, blonde and built to last
Billy was a no-good guitar picker runnin' from his past


Listenin' to his songs she heard nothin' but bad news
Still she made her mind up to try to get him win or lose

Jessi liked the Cadillacs and diamonds on her hands
Waymore had a reputation as a lady's man
Late one night her light of love finally gave a sign
Jessi parked her Cadillac and took her place in line''''''''''''''''''
