I guess I should have seen it coming
I should have read those warning signs
But her leavin' me was something
That never even crossed my mind
Till she said...

See ya, wouldn't want to be ya
Wouldn't want to stand in your shoes
And watch me walking out on you
It's too late, you're finding out the hard way
Boy, I'll see ya
I wouldn't want to be ya

She was standing at the door when I told her
I was sorry for the things I didn't say
I asked for one more chance to start all over
But it's over was all over her face''''''''''''''''''
