Yeah, you know I came up in a small town
Couple trees and a creek we could float down
Ain't much to see when you look around, just farms for miles
And you can find me ridin' round on some 33's
Cocked back kickin' dirt on my John D's
International harvestin' us some whole wheat
Yeah let's take a ride

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Just livin' the farm life, yeah we're livin' the farm life
With that back road swagger that's how we roll
We plow it and we plant it and we drive it real slow
In the farm life, just livin' the farm life

We're waking up in the more before the sun does
Feed the cows and the chickens and the ducky ducks
Ain't got a lot but we got enough
Yeah, you know it's all about...
Touchin' dirt with your bare hands
Fix it up taking care of your family
Wife it up become a family man
Ooh, just settle down

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Just livin' the farm life, yeah we're livin' the farm life
It's county line simple don't complicate it,
Big city living no it's over rated
In the farm life, just livin' the farm life

Drink some shine get a little sauce
Get your girl, kick it back, kick your boots off
Maybe wake up in somebody's hay loft
Hehe, if you know what I mean (I do)
We could park it down there on the tail gate
Talk about nothing till the day break
Amarillo by morning by George Strait
Yeah, we got it on repeat!

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Just livin' the farm life, yeah we're livin' the farm life
Out here we know how to treat a girl right
Take her by the hand and love her all night
In the farm life, just livin' the farm life

Oh yeah
Come on, Come on, Come on
Yeah we're living the farm life''''''''''''''''''
