Look, we just rolled in, me and three of my friends,
Got on my boots and jeans, I'm a redneck king.
Saw Jack and Jim and some good time shine
And then a friend of yours is a friend of mine
All I want is a seat, all I need is a beek,
I live the life like a rhyme, still standing in line.
But that's all right with me, 'cause I'm a regular joke.
Don't wanna be a star, yo, just a part of the show.
Ain't trying to be cool, won't suffer the fools,
So it goes, short, funny, you can keep your money.
I keep my truck, you keep your fancy car.
If you're looking for me I'll be right at the bar.

There's plenty of room at the bar,
Plenty of room at the bar,
If you don't like the rat race, we've got the right place,
It's plenty of room at the bar.

Cast away on the island of the misfit toys,
I spent my youth taking shit from all the girls and boys
Till I learned to get along with me, myself and I.
I got soft, 'cause good boys don't cry.
They called me a freak, now I'm living up to the label,
I'm hungry as hell and I want my place at the table
So I stop into this high class joint.
Looking for some dinner, but the odds are getting thinner,
Yeah, I'm checking at the lobby, but they say I'm late.
They put my name at the bottom of the chart and say I have to wait
A dress code, who's that guy over there?
Wearing the T shirt and jeans with all that gel in his hair.
That's not fair, but I guess it's just the way that it goes,
If you don't have reservations, then you better know the host.
Otherwise, be advised, they'll put you out with the trash,
In the cold, you'll be begging for scraps.
But I'm not playing that game, I know a place down the street
Where they never judge a brother by the shoes on his feet,
They welcome everybody come from near and far,
There's always plenty of room at the bar.

There's plenty of room at the bar,
Plenty of room at the bar,
If you don't like the rat race, we've got the right place,
It's plenty of room at the bar.
There's plenty of room at the bar.

Come on in, grab a seat,
Right here we ain't bailing people, but you can tap your feet.
Now grab a drink and don't stress,
We're gonna treat you like a friend, no matter how you dress.
No matter where you come from, this is where you are,
Don't swap the grill, sit back and chill,
Everybody here is gonna make you feel like a star.

There's plenty of room at the bar,
Plenty of room at the bar,
If you don't like the rat race, we've got the right place,
It's plenty of room at the bar.
There's plenty of room at the bar,
Plenty of room at the bar,
If you don't like the rat race, we've got the right place,
It's plenty of room at the bar.
There's plenty of room at the bar,
There's plenty of room at the bar,
There's plenty of room at the bar.''''''''''''''''''
