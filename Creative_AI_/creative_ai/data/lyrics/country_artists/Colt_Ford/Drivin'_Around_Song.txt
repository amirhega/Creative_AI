This is for everybody out there, circling the town square,
Proud to be stuck out in the middle of nowhere
USA, Chevrolet, dodge and Ford, rising a little hell and praising the Lord

Just simple truth speaking, workin' for the weekend
Every time it hits the fan you just keep on keeping
You tried and true, red white and blue
Turn it up, turn it up, man, this one's for you

Hey, this is for the driving around, jack 'n' diane town, anywhere Saturday night
Yeah, yeah, this is for the back road, turning up the radio, heading right
Where the two lane turns into main st, cruising the same streets,
Over in the passenger seat
Baby ain't never looked better just singing along
To this driving around song

Yeah, I know what I'm talking about, I grew up in the low rams
Camp down them days, like I'm brave enough to bus down
City lights in my size, I'm gonna do it upright,
I'm sitting here with this guitar tonight
Getting in the big town, wishing not to slow it down
And I give anything if I was driving around with the big dreams in my pocket
Yeah, this is for the ones who don't know how do they got it

Hey, this is for the driving around, jacking downtown, anywhere Saturday night
Yeah, yeah, this is for the back road, turning up the radio, heading back
Where the two lane, take down the back seats, cruising the same streets,
Covering the passenger seat
Yeah, there ain't never the minute to sing it along,
To this driving around song

All right, everybody,
Get in your truck, get in your car, whatever it is
Small town America, baby,
We're going drive it around

Hey, this is for the driving around, jacking downtown, anywhere Saturday night
Yeah, yeah, this is for the back road, turning up the radio, heading back
Where the two lane, take down the back seats, cruising the same streets,
Covering the passenger seat
Yeah, there ain't never the minute to sing it along,
To this driving around song'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
