Let me tell y'all a little story

Growin' up I remember one year
My uncle Titus had a bright idear
He's gonna bottle up his own brew
He figured he could make a million or two
Taste wasn't gonna be his claim to fame
What he was bankin' on was all in the name
He called it

Titty's Titty's Titty's Beer
Just the thing to get you grinnin' ear to ear
Whether you're from the country or a big ol' city
One things for sure everybody loves titty's

He had his marketing plan worked up
He's gonna sell 'em all in big ol' jugs
He wouldn't package 'em in a six pack
He's gonna sell 'em by the pair and call it a rack
And he was sure it was the next big thing
With Dolly Parton in his ad campaign
Selling

Titty's Titty's Titty's Beer
Just the thing to get you grinnin' ear to ear
Whether you're from the country or a big ol' city
One things for sure everybody loves titty's

Happy hour two for one
Talkin' 'bout a beer buzz son
After work at the ball game or shootin' the bull
Anytime is the right time for a big ol' hand full of

Titty's Titty's Titty's Beer
Just the thing to get you grinnin' ear to ear
Whether you're from the country or a big ol' city
One things for sure everybody loves titty's

One things for sure everybody loves titty's
When you work real hard and your day's gone shitty
What could be better than a big ol' mouthful of titty's'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
