He was just stacking up in twenty two else clubs,
And his eyes were shot redder than the sun coming up,
As I cared to his name, getting ready for the game,
Everybody knows what he's gonna do
Gonna run around and hold up, do you know Hugh?

Do you know Hugh? Do you know Hugh?
Everybody wanna get a little drunk tonight,
Hugh Damn Right, Hugh Damn Right.
Do you know Hugh? Do you know Hugh?
Everybody wanna get a little drunk tonight,
Hugh Damn Right, Hugh Damn Right.

Through the beers and the years, never changed his gears,
Every time I ever saw him he raising and howling
Had a big old grin, three sheets to the wind,
'Bout three eighty five, but everybody called him slim.
Ask him son, what you been up to?
He said hell, you know me, but do you know Hugh?

Do you know Hugh? Do you know Hugh?
Everybody wanna get a little drunk tonight,
Hugh Damn Right, Hugh Damn Right.
Do you know Hugh? Do you know Hugh?
Everybody wanna get a little drunk tonight,
Hugh Damn Right, Hugh Damn Right.

When I saw that country girl said Lord, have mercy, look in here,
This ain't no white girl, she like chasing Jack o Dear.
But I get my game on, can't let this one bolt.
She came in here and looked me in the eyes and said, quote

Do you wanna have a good time, do you wanna have a good time?
Do you wanna have a good time? A really, really good time.
Do you wanna have a good time? I sure do.

I looked her up and down and said:

Do you know Hugh? Do you know Hugh?
Everybody wanna get a little drunk tonight,
Hugh Damn Right, Hugh Damn Right.
Do you know Hugh? Do you know Hugh?
Are you near or are you cool but I'm there in line
Hugh Damn Right, Hugh Damn Right.
Is it Jack, is it Jim or a moon shine night.
Hugh Damn Right, Hugh Damn Right.
If you're tall or off on the floor up tonight,
Hugh Damn Right, Hugh Damn Right.

Hugh Damn Right, Hugh Damn Right.''''''''''''''''''
