'Round here we was raised in the church
We worked when we was hurt
And was proud of our dirt
God came first and He still does
Some things will always be just like they was
Life's still good 'round here everyday
Ask anyone, betcha they all say

That's because we're country kids
How it was is how it is
Yeah, that's the way we all were raised
Reckon some things ain't never gonna change
It's in our blood everywhere we go
From the city streets to them old back roads
No matter how young or old we get
We'll always be country kids

Shellin' butter beans on the porch with Grandma
Learnin' how to cut the grass on the lap of Grandpa
On that old John Deere, Lord the thing still runs
Learned how to bait a hook and how to shoot a gun
Life's still good 'round here everyday
Ask anyone, I betcha they all say

That's because we're country kids
How it was is how it is
Yeah, that's the way we all were raised
Reckon some things ain't never gonna change
It's in our blood everywhere we go
From the city streets to them old back roads
No matter how young or old we get
We'll always be country kids

From New York City to the Georgia pines
From Hollywood to the Bible belt
No y'all we ain't too hard to find
No we ain't hard to find

That's because we're country kids
How it was is how it is
Yeah, that's the way we all were raised
Reckon some things ain't never gonna change
It's in our blood everywhere we go
From the city streets to them old dirt roads
No matter how young or old we get
We'll always be country kids

Yeah from the moment we're born
Till we're a hundred and six
We'll always be country kids''''&''''&''''&''''''
