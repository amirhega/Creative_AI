Buck 'em!
I put my life on the line
8 seconds at a time
In it for the money baby
And strictly the shine
I'm gold buckles, white knuckles
Even when I'm hurt
And I'm a cowboy up till I'm under the dirt
I been stomped and throwed
I been bucked and banged
But I'm a cowboy baby so it ain't no thang
Got on my chaps and boots
Climb up in the chutes
Nod my head and I'm gone
Ride 'em all night long!
I'm a nod and hold on till the day that I'm gone
Got on my Wrangler jeans with the Copenhagen ring
Boots by Rocky, damn right I'm cocky
Built Ford tough, ain't nothin' can stop me
So, ice the Bud Light, nod at the gate man
Down in the well or away from my hand
I'm a ride who I draw, for night moves to big bucks
Call
Say that, tell 'em bring in the big trucks
I need help to carry all this cash
96 and a half on scene at the crash
Fire up the grill tell Johnsonville
Put some Brats on, we party all night long
It's Las Vegas baby, where the players play
PBR, VIP up in Mandalay Bay
Yeah I'm a cowboy, yeah I'm a roughneck
I wear Mossy Oak, I hunt with Bowtech
I read your? Prefert?, got me in Branson
A big tractor, fear is no factor
Call me on ED mobile 'cause I'm nationwide
It's the PBR baby, one hell of a ride!
I put my life on the line
8 seconds at a time
In it for the money baby
And strictly the shine
I'm gold buckles, white knuckles
Even when I'm hurt
And I'm a cowboy up till I'm under the dirt
I been stomped and throwed
I been bucked and banged
But I'm a cowboy baby so it ain't no thang
Got on my chaps and boots
Climb up in the chutes
Nod my head and I'm gone
Ride 'em all night long!
The toughest sport on dirt
My middle name is Hurt, but still I
Rosin my glove, rodeo is my love
Drawin' neon nights and just a dream is fine
Spurin' for 8 seconds all that's on my mind
Gettin' hung up and hooked
That's just part of the deal
We got them chinky bull fighters and they harder than steel
This's as real as it gets
I pray nothin' will harm me
That's why we teamed up with the US Army
Call Enterprise if you needin' a ride
So you can see the greatest show on dirt
Put your Stetson on, get your Cripple Creek Shirt
This's as real as it gets
They need a Rod Smith
Greg Crabtree from all the PBR
You the star that's still gon' shine
And every night this cowboy's gon' lay it on the line
I put my life on the line
8 seconds at a time
In it for the money baby
And strictly the shine
I'm gold buckles, white knuckles
Even when I'm hurt
And I'm a cowboy up till I'm under the dirt
I been stomped and throwed
I been bucked and banged
But I'm a cowboy baby so it ain't no thang
Got on my chaps and boots
Climb up in the chutes
Nod my head and I'm gone
Ride 'em all night long!
This ain't no rodeo baby, this is the PBR
Toughest sport on dirt
I get Holst for the ride
I go by the name Colt Ford
What's up to BMW Hitches, Big Tex Trailers
Fritos, my boys at Jack Daniels
Humberto, Daisy, Cabella
Don't forget about Yamaha
This is real men doin' cowboy thangs
Colt Ford and the PBR
We ain't never scared
Say I won't!'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
