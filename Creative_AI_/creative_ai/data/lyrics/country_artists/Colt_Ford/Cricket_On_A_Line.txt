I got a cricket on the line
And a bottle of shine
A whipper will wistlin
Everything is fine
I got my plow boy bunny sittin' by my side
What else does a country boy need to survive

Let me hear ya say hey we want some country
Hey we want some country
Let me hear ya say hey we want some country
Hey we want some country

Hey Y'all, it's me again
Time to get it on with my country friends
Got girls, got trucks, got mud,
Y'all know what's up
Do you wanna know what it's like to sip some
Moonshine by the moon light
Well come on down, well show you around
Load up the truck, take you into town
Head to miss bettys lunch is ready
Stop by the house, get mom and daddy
Drop 'em off there at the walmart
Got to get to the lake before it gets dark
Load the boat in
Call my friends
Make the first left when the black top ends
Ease on back 'bout a mile or two
Then you can see just what were doin'

I got a cricket on the line
And a bottle of shine
A whipper will wistlin
Everything is fine
I got my plow boy bunny sittin' by my side
What else does a country boy need to survive

Let me hear ya say hey we want some country
Hey we want some country
Let me hear ya say hey we want some country
Hey we want some country

Y'all have mercy
Here we are in the middle of field
Who needs a bar

This here is a country party
Y'all get drunk and be somebody
I know you like my southern draw
Holla say yes mahm and y'all
That's in my dna
Good god ol mighty is what I say
When I see those cursin boots
Flat bottomed girls and them daisy dukes
They sweeter then momma cobbler
Hold on a minute somethings pullin on my bobber
I think I got a bite
Heat the grease up fish fry tonight
So if you wanna see me and Rhett
Somewhere in the country is your best bet

I got a cricket on the line
And a bottle of shine
A whipper will wistlin
Everything is fine
I got my plow boy bunny sittin' by my side
What else does a country boy need to survive

Let me hear ya say hey we want some country
Hey we want some country
Let me hear ya say hey we want some country
Hey we want some country

I got a cricket on the line
And a bottle of shine
A whipper will wistlin
Everything is fine
I got my plow boy bunny sittin' by my side
What else does a country boy need to survive

Let me hear ya say hey we want some country
Hey we want some country
Let me hear ya say hey we want some country
Hey we want some country

I got a cricket on the line
And a bottle of shine''''&''''&''''&''''''
