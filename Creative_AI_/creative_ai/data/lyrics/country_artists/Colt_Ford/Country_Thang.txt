Shotgun shack on the edge of town
It's where I'll be when the sun goes down
Big money, bird dog barkin' out back
Wouldn't trade him in for a Cadillac
County wanna pave my old dirt road
Went to the courthouse, said "Hell no"

It's a country thang, it's a fish on a string
Mary Jane chompin' on a chicken wing
It's a tire swing on a riverbank
It's the way we talk, it's the way we sing
It's either in your blood or it ain't
It's a country thang

Known my girl since she was fourteen
She's the first runner up to the Hard Candy Cotton Queen
She was raised on cornbread, purple hull peas
She turns 'em heads at the feed 'n seed
She rides in the middle of my four-wheel drive
Got a honey hole way back in the pines

It's a country thang, it's some cutoff jeans
Paintin' her toes on a porch swing
Sweet like sugar cane, come a good rain
Make a little love while the tin roof sings
It's either in your blood or it ain't
It's a country thang

It's a country thang, barefoot and crazy
Fried green tomatoes and sawmill gravy
Takin' pride in workin' hard for a livin'
Pray before meals, it feels good givin'
Back to the needy, greedy's not us
Thank God for it, even if it ain't much
That's how we does it down here in the mud
What else can I say, y'all, it's in my blood

It's either in your blood or it ain't
That's how we does it 'round here
It's either in your blood or it ain't
C'mon, y'all
It's a country thang
It's a country thang
It's a country thang

It's just a country thang''''''''''''''''''
