I remember Sunday morning, getting up when I was a kid
Heading out towards east dipple, that's where folks back then did
We'd sing all following verses from Amazing Grace
Then dad did hard drop money in the plate

After Sunday school it was Davis brother's chicken
It was sweeter than molasses, funny how time passes
I never knew back then how my life would be now
How far I wonder off that narrow road I went down

Don't know where I'm going or where it's all gone
Sometimes I feel like I sold myself for a song
I'm surrounded by all of these sixteen dreams
Standing in the spot line and can't see a thing

I'm sick and damn tired of all the hustling and scamming
Man, I'd give it all up to get back to Avon
I look around for something I can still believe in
I'm dreaming of angels but living with demons

I'm thinking about my life now and what it used to be
Now that I see behind the curtain, nothing's new to me
I know some fallen angels try to take me down
And I've got a few good time buddies, whiskey beam and hell bound

Another sleepless night with a rod guitar
It's screaming in my veins, about to drive me insane
But I woke up Sunday morning to the church's bells ringing
And somewhere in my heart it's still a choir singing

Don't know where I'm going or where it's all gone
Sometimes I feel like I sold myself for a song
I'm surrounded by all of these sixteen dreams
Standing in the spot line and can't see a thing

I'm sick and damn tired of all the hustling and scamming
Man, I'd give it all up to get back to Avon
I look around for something I can still believe in
I'm dreaming of angels but living with demons

Hey, how you doing? I know it's been a while
I've been running crazy and that ain't really no excuse
But this whole world is running crazy
People killing each other, fighting wars

We forgot about You and a lot of places
And the truth is, we still really need You
I really need You
So I promise I won't stay away so long this time

I'll be back sooner than later
Thanks for always care for me when I was too weak to walk
Well, I gotta get out of here but I'll talk to You again soon
Thanks, God''&''&''&''&''&''&''&''&''&
