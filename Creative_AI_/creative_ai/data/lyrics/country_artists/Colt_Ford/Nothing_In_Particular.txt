Man, been workin hard all week
Monday to Friday
Today, I guess I'm just goin' do uh...
Man I guess I'm goin' do nothing in particular
Anybody wants to come do that with me
Y'all are welcome, c'mon

Nothing in particular, and I'm doin' it all day long, a hot grill and a cooler of beer and a CD of my favorite songs, a lotta
Nothing in particular and I do it well, so much of nothing on the schedule now, and I'm invitin' all of y'all to help

Ain't doin' nothing in particular just livin' my life, I thank the lord for my friends, family, youngin's, and wife, another
Day in the country and it sure feels good, ain't no hustle and bustle out here in the woods, just a lot of good folks, a lot
Of hard work, a whole lot of love for the man above, everyday is a blessing I'm above the ground, around here folks wave when
You ride through town, ain't got no schedule for myself to do, might fire up the grill, or play some horseshoes, wherever I'm
At is right where I'll be, so load up your trucks, and come hang with me, I'm doin'...

Nothing in particular, and I'm doin' it all day long, a hot grill and a cooler of beer and a CD of my favorite songs, a lotta
Nothing in particular and I do it well, so much of nothing on the schedule now, and I'm invitin' all of y'all to help

Now y'all listen up, 'cause I'm a tell you the truth, that there ain't nothing better than jeans and boots, ridin' in a truck on
An old dirt road, and crankin' up Waylon on the radio, knowin' that tomorrow may or may not come, but today is all good out

Here in the woods, life in the country is a blessin' y'all, eatin' deep fried turkey with some dressin' y'all, there ain't no
Reason for stressin' y'all, just do what I do, and y'all gonna have a ball, so don't take no plans on this here day, when they
Ask you what your doin', this is what you say
Just livin' and lovin', laughin' and thankin' god for the day, what else can I say, so load up your truck and come hang with
Me, I'm doin' nothing in particular, y'all come see, I'm doin'...

Nothing in particular, and I'm doin' it all day long, a hot grill and a cooler of beer and a CD of my favorite songs, a lotta
Nothing in particular and I do it well, so much of nothing on the schedule now, and I'm invitin' all of y'all to help

Nothing in particular,
(We do this stuff all day) and I'm doin' it all day long,
(Country girls come out and play, we always get it on this way)
A hot grill and a cooler of beer and a CD of my favorite songs, a lotta nothing in particular
(We can do this stuff all day)
And I do it well,
(Country girls come out and play, we always get it on this way)
So much of nothing on the schedule now, and I'm invitin' all of y'all to help''''&''''&''''&''''''
