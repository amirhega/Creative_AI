I been hipper, folks, talking 'bout the Boondocks
Singing 'bout the hollers waiting back in the woods
Don't know nothing, ain't ever been mudding
Gotta get a little dirty like a country boy should

Come on down, pitch a rib, get a swallow
Son, we live so far back in the hollow

We'll pipe the sunshine in and the moonshine out
Gonna show you what a real hillbilly's about
Light up the smoke and pass the jug around
Get drunk in a good ol' round

Ain't hayseed, honey, don't care about the money
Just a super big black muffler's sound
We're tearing it up and throwing it down
We'll pipe the sunshine in and the moonshine out

You wanna know how to get here, follow them John Deeres
Place this small ain't on the map
Whiskey in the mountain and, Lord, I just love it here
Get a little swig of this sour mash

Come on down, pitch a rib, get a swallow
Son, we live so far back in the hollow

We'll pipe the sunshine in and the moonshine out
Gonna show you what a real hillbilly's about
Light up the smoke and pass the jug around
Get drunk in a good ol' round

Ain't hayseed, honey, don't care about the money
Just a super big black muffler's sound
We're tearing it up and throwing it down
We'll pipe the sunshine in and the moonshine out

Come on down, if you think you can hang
We'll be kicking up dust and raise us a Cain
This a hillbilly hoedown, redneck throw down
Country kind of thing

We'll pipe the sunshine in and the moonshine out
We'll show you what a real hillbilly's about
Light up your smoke, pass the jug around
Get drunk in a good ol' round, yeah

Ain't hayseed, honey, don't care about the money
Just a super big black muffler's sound
We're tearing it up and throwing it down
We'll pipe the sunshine in, we'll pipe the sunshine in
We'll pipe the sunshine in, yeah, and the moonshine out

Way back in the back roads
We'll pipe the sunshine in and the moonshine out''''''''''''''''''
