There's a little girl, in our neighborhood
Her name is Charlotte Johnson and she's really lookin' good
I had to go and see her, so I called her on the phone
I walked over to her house, and this was goin' on

Her brother was on the sofa, eatin' chocolate pie
Her moma was in the kitchen cuttin' chicken up to fry
Her daddy was in the back yard rollin' up a garden hose
I was on the porch with Charlotte feelin' love down to my toes

And we were swingin' (swinging)
Yes we were swingin' (swinging)
Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on the front porch swing
Just a swingin' (swingin')
Just a swingin' (swingin')

Now Charlotte she's a darlin' she's the apple of my eye
When I'm on the swing with her it makes me almost high
Now Charlotte is my lover and she has been since the spring
I can't believe it started on her front porch in the swing'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
