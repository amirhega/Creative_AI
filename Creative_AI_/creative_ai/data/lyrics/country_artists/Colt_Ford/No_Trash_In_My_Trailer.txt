Yes I live in a single wide, to get up here it takes a four wheel drive.
Got a mean ass dog whose name is Sickem Sam.
I got a motor hangin' from a tree, a satellite dish and a trampoline.
A sixty-eight red chevelle, been known to raise a little hell.
All night, bar fightin some of you all say I ain't liven right
Eat butterbeans and fried spam.
But I ain't what you all say I am.

Cause there ain't no trash in my trailer. Though you might find an empty can of beer.
No there ain't been no trash in my trailer oh no. Since the day I threw you out of here.

I burn my trash in a drum. Sometimes I shoot my gun.
I'm mud boggin, camouflagen, a ball game is what I'm watchen.
I work hard, mow the yard, fish, hunt, knuckle scar, change oil, plow the soil, love a boat country boy.
I wear a suit to church and stuff and Daddy's the one that made me tuff.
He told me son, don't be ashamed of who you are and our family name.
I'm makin' it proud, sayin' it loud, doin' my thing a country crowd.
I tell you the truth and don't give a damn. But I ain't what you all say I am.

Cause there ain't no trash in my trailer.
Though you might find an empty can of beer.
No there ain't been no trash in my trailer oh no.
Since the day I threw you out of here.

Cause there ain't no trash in my trailer.
Though you might find an empty can of beer.
No there ain't been no trash in my trailer oh no.
Since the day I threw you out of here.

No there's no trailer trash livin' here.''''''''''''''''''
