Friday night, we were hanging out down at the river, everybody just chilling,
It was me and my boys and a whole bunch of girls, love and laugh in that feeling.
Nothing but a good time, Jinny looks so fine, I hear at boys it's all on me,
Nothing but the blur, just me and her, lost in the moment, it makes me wanna,

I'd trade all of my tomorrows just to keep on feeling like this,
These moments are better than anything I'm ever gonna miss.
Uh, baby.
Ain't never gonna miss that, no.
Ain't never gonna miss that.

Saturday, I woke up, tasted strawberry on my lips.
Man, I ain't never danced like that, Lord, the girl moves those hips.
Momma's jelly and the dad is telling me that I should really slow down,
It's on the night and I'm still a ride, 'cause this is my time and my town.

I'd trade all of my tomorrows just to keep on feeling like this,
These moments are better than anything I'm ever gonna miss.
Uh, baby.
Ain't never gonna miss that.

Just when you're young and all you do is race the sun
And every night you chase the moon,
You pray it doesn't end too soon.
End too soon.

Saying
I'd trade all of my tomorrows just to keep on feeling like this,
These moments are better than anything I'm ever gonna miss.
I'd trade all of my tomorrows just to keep on feeling like this,
These moments are better than anything I'm ever gonna miss.
I'm never gonna miss that.
Never gonna miss that.
Ain't never gonna miss that.
I'm never gonna miss that.
Ain't never gonna miss that.''''''''''''''''''
