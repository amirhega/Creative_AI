It's why the color pink was made
It's why we wear cheap aftershave and bathe
It's why we left the cave

It's why we learned to play guitar
Use chopsticks and a sushi bar
It's why we butcher poetry
You make payments on a big ol' diamond ring

It's all about y'all
Yeah, why we bathe, why we crawl
Why we aim to please, baby

It's all about y'all
Make us crazy, girls, women
I don't believe this
It's why the whole world be fun
It's all about y'all

Drop our friends and exercise
Watch chick flicks and pretend to cry
Trade whiskey for a bottle of good red wine

It's why was invented
It's why tuxedos get rented
It's why well say that's interesting
When you're so hot is what we really mean

It's all about y'all
Yeah, why we bathe, why we crawl
Why we aim to please, baby

It's all about y'all
Make us crazy, girls, women
I don't believe this
It's why the whole world be fun

It's all about y'all

On the cover of men's
And women's magazines
Daytime, nighttime TV
Shopping malls, wall to wall
You've written everything

You see, we take the bait
Get caught in the fish net
Lord, here she goes
Just licks her lips wet, woo
High heels striking like lightning
She's got best friends fighting, yeah

And the band crescendos
Take you all aboard
All thought went out the window
She stars batting the lashes
Hundred dollar bills goin' up in ashes,
Yeah

It's all about y'all
Yeah, why we bathe, why we crawl
Why we aim to please, baby

It's all about y'all
Make us crazy, girls, women
I don't believe this
It's why the whole world be fun
It's all about y'all

It's all about y'all'''''&''''''&''''''&''''''''''
