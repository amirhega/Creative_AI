Man, I've been riding through the country for a while now
Ain't nothing like home, but y'all make everywhere fell like home for me
Let's go

They say home is where you hang your hat
But it's hard when you a music man
Gotta give my heart and soul every night to another fan
From Alabama out to Texas up to Washington
Then headin' home to wash some clothes and do it all again
Gotta head to Chattanooga, Knoxville, and to VA
To by god West Virginia country folks come out to play
Run down to North Carolina make a stop in Greenville
Head on over to Myrtle Beach, House Of Blues y'all know the deal
Everyday another place, every night another show
From Mississippi to Missouri man I gotta go
See every night is different, but really it's all the same
It's all about the fans, hell y'all can keep the fame

I spend my life on the road but I never feel alone
I can have a mansion on a hill but it's only brick and stone
I love small towns and I love big crowds, I guess that's just how I roll
'Cause I'm surrounded by the people that I love and that's what I call home

Headin' out to Billy Bob then hit Louisianan
Take off to Arkansas so I can spill some country grammar
Run out to Kansas city then visit Illinois
Country folks are everywhere y'all better make some country noise
Head up to Michigan then maybe Montreal
Step off in New York City so I can holla hey y'all
Head out to California I love some Arizona
Vegas and Oregon they always have some country fun
Stop in Oklahoma Wyoming and Nebraska
North and South Dakota, might even hit up Alaska
Wisconsin Minnesota, Iowa, and of course Kentucky
Ohio Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida damn I'm lucky
I'll stop in Indiana or maybe Idaho
I love it in Montana and Colorado
No matter where I go, no matter where I roam
I truly love all y'all, you make it feel like home

I spend my life on the road but I never feel alone
I can have a mansion on a hill but it's only brick and stone
I love small towns and I love big crowds, I guess that's just how I roll
'Cause I'm surrounded by the people that I love and that's what I call home

Man every night I get to play music
For the greatest fans in the whole wide world
And I'ma keep on doin' what Colt Ford does
Cause that's all I know how to do
So whenever I come to your town out of the woods to that big city
Just remember it will be just like going home
Let's go

I spend my life on the road but I never feel alone
I can have a mansion on a hill but it's only brick and stone
I love small towns and I love big crowds, I guess that's just how I roll
'Cause I'm surrounded by the people that I love and that's what I call home

I spend my life on the road but I never feel alone
I can have a mansion on a hill but it's only brick and stone
I love small towns and I love big crowds, I guess that's just how I roll
'Cause I'm surrounded by the people that I love and that's what I call home''''''''''''''''''
