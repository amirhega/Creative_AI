This a straight up redneck rager
Doing body shots of yager, Let er' rip
We on that moonshine and we're sipping on Bacardi

What happens in the backwoods, stays in the backwoods
We goin' ham y'all hard as a mother...
So crank it up, (Whoot Whoot) put some of that party in my cup, (Whoot Whoot)
Y'all I'm dancing with a girl up on my flatbed,
She hotter than a cherry on a marlboro red, wow

We goin' ham y'all hard as a mother...
