Man she's... she's like everything you've ever... you've ever dreamed of
She's so perfectly imperfect
Watch the way she works it
Blowing like a summer breeze
Sweeter than a Georgia peach
She's like rollin' with the top down
Every little small town
Even in the big city
Everywhere you look around
She's like a free round of drinks at my favourite bar
She's like a new set of strings on my old guitar
She's like a pedal to the medal in my muscle car
She's a wide open road

She's like a hit song on the radio
And I can't escape her everywhere that I go
She's got me singing along when she comes on
Her memory moves me all night long
She's with me everywhere that I go
She's got me singing like whoa oh oh oh oh oh
She's got me singing like whoa oh oh oh oh oh

She's like (my favourite song like)
She's like (you know my song like)
She's like (I sing along like)
She

She's like hotter than the summer sun
An angel ridin' shotgun
A devil in a sundress
Sweet and sexy hot mess
She's a Carolina sun rise
California sunset
She's anything you want, man

She's like a free round of drinks at my favourite bar
She's like a new set of strings on my old guitar
She's like a pedal to the medal in my muscle car
She's a wide open road (so let's roll)

She's like a hit song on the radio
And I can't escape her everywhere that I go
She's got me singing along when she comes on
Her memory moves me all night long
She's with me everywhere that I go
She's got me singing like whoa oh oh oh oh oh
She's got me singing like whoa oh oh oh oh oh

She keeps the party going all night long
If you know what I mean, then you can sing along
She keeps the party going all night long
And if you know what I mean, then you can sing along, sing along!
