It's all headlights, it's all Friday nights,
It's all football, it's all hey y'all,
It's all muscle car, it's all shitty bar,
It's all honkey thongs, it's all but donkey dong,
K-dong, k-dong, k-dong, k-dong.
It's all John Deere, it's all cold beer,
It's all Jim Dean, it's all home team,
It's all catfish, it's all cheese grits,
It's all cornfield, you know the deal.

Where are you when the time stand still,
Got my heart up in the hills in the middle of the fields,
Where the drinks fly over and the trains pass through
And there's nothing else to do but do what you do.

It's all big buck, it's all loud truck,
It's all kung dog, we eat the whole whole,
It's all yes mam, it's all no sir,
It's all laid back, it's all hard work,
It's all have fun, it's get your bail run,
It's all knock down, it's all never run,
It's all American, it's all mainstream,
It's all Greenwich kitchen, there ain't no bitcin'.

Where are you when the time stand still,
Got my heart up in the hills in the middle of the fields,
Where the drinks fly over and the trains pass through
And there's nothing else to do but do what you do.

It's all scoring, it's all blue jean,
It's all gunshot, it's all work boot,
It's all Walmart, it's all car park,
It's all big dream, it's all book hard,
It's all front porch, it's all rockin' chair,
It's all deep fry, it's all county fare,
It's all church crowd, it's all real loud,
It's all flag fly, it's all damn proud.

Where are you when the time stand still,
Got my heart up in the hills in the middle of the fields,
Where the drinks fly over and the trains pass through
And there's nothing else to do but do what you do.
