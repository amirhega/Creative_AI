I roll up in my two ton, black and orange harley two tone.
Texas longhorn on the grill.
Two sexy ladies hanging from the wheel.
The music thumpin' down in the club.
I see a honey blowin' wranglers up.
She top heavy with the long dark hair.
Jeans are stuffed like a build a bear.

I think I seen her on a mud flap.
Chrome rack and a swayed back.
Can't help but stare when she's built like that,
Those curves she got give me a heart attack.
A little dirty but she cleans up nice,
A taste of sugar but a lotta spice.
Hit reverse, baby bring it on back.
I think I seen her on a mud flap.

I bet you're rollin' in the royal tees.
I'd like to peek inside your treasure weed.
I've even seen you on the rearview glass;
Devil horns, angel wings on back.
Covered in chrome, girl you got real flash.
Dubs like a truck, is every hit your nav.

I think I seen her on a mud flap.
Chrome rack and a swayed back.
Can't help but stare when she's built like that,
Those curves she got give me a heart attack.
A little dirty but she cleans up nice,
A taste of sugar but a lotta spice.
Hit reverse, baby bring it on back.
I think I seen her on a mud flap.

Don't be scared it's just a ride.
I'll even let you drop into 4 wheel drive.

I think I seen her on a mud flap.
Chrome rack and a swayed back.
Can't help but stare when she's built like that,
Those curves she got give me a heart attack.
A little dirty but she cleans up nice,
A taste of sugar but a lotta spice.
Hit reverse, baby bring it on back.
I think I seen her on a mud flap.''''&''''&''''&''''''
