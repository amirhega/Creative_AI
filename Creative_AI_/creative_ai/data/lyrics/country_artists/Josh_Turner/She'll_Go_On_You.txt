If you got a little girl
You'd better take the time
To go to her tea parties
Give her a piggy-back ride
Be a dragon or a dinosaur
Every chance you get
'Cause one day you can bet...

She'll go on you
Before you can turn around
And it's so lonely
Watching that fast train leaving town
You better cherish her
Every second of your life
'Cause this precious little thing
That we call time
She'll go on you

If you got a special one
You'd better love her everyday
Leave her notes on the 'frigerator door
And send her sweet bouquets
Always be a confidant
A safe place for her to rest
Oh that little thing you call your happiness...

She'll go on you
Before you can turn around
And it's so lonely
Watching that fast train leaving town
You better cherish her
Every second of your life
Take her in your arms
And do her right
She'll go on you

If you got your mamma there
You outa thank her everyday
For nursing all your colds
And sitting up when you stay up late
All her hair is grey
And every year she's not as strong
One of these days
Before too long...

She'll go on you
Before you can turn around
And it's so lonely
Watching that fast train leaving town
You better cherish her
Every second of your life
'Cause before you get the chance
To say goodbye
She'll go on you

Yeah this precious little thing
That we call life
She'll go on you
...Yeah she will...'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
