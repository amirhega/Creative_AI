Like any other would be country singin' sensation
I had no visible means of transportation
One Saturday mornin' I was searchin' the ads
When I found one that I wanted and I wanted it bad
(He found one that he wanted and he wanted it bad)

I called up the salesmen, he said, c'mon in
I've got the Lincoln right here belonged to Loretta Lynn
The Coalminer's Daughter used to drive it to town
It's yours for a song and five hundred down
(He said, it's yours for a song and five hundred down)

I said, Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
Yeah, Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
I had no idea what that dealer was thinkin'
But he totted the note on Loretta Lynn's Lincoln

Well, I throwed my ol' guitar in that big back seat
And I steared her on out on to Dameron Street
Them other cars pulled over like the red sea had parted
It was then I had a vision of Dolly Parton
(Right there he had a vision of Dolly Parton)

She said, ain't that Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
Yeah, it's Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
She said, I thought I recognized them two headlights blinkin'
I do declare, that there's Loretta Lynn's Lincoln

Dolly said, slide over J Otis, let me take you downtown
Miss Loretta's waitin' for us at the Orchid Lounge
I couldn't believe my ears, I couldn't believe my eyes
Why she was wavin' from the curb and we drove by
Well, we turned that big rig around, right on a dime
I ain't seen nothin' like that since Red Solvine (Red Solvine)
That's what Loretta was sayin' as she hopped in the back
Then she said, hey, Hoss, ain't this my old Cadillac
No mame, Miss Loretta, this ain't your Cadillac

It's Loretta Lynn's Lincoln (Loretta)
Yeah, Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
(It's Loretta Lynn's Lincoln)
The radio was on and we was all lipsinkin'
Ridin' 'round Nashville in Loretta Lynn's Lincoln, whooo

I heard a tappin' on the window as I woke up
Neath an old newspaper in my pickup truck
The policeman said, boy, you better hit the road jack
Get that bucket of bolts back across the tracks
Officer, this here's Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
(And he said) son, that ain't Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
Yeah, I was wakin' up and my dreams were sinkin'
Like them ol' springs on Loretta Lynn's Lincoln

Yeah, Loretta Lynn's Lincoln (Loretta, Loretta)
Whooo, Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
(That is Loretta Lynn's Lincoln)
If you ever get to wonderin' what I was a-dreamin'
I was dreamin' I was ridin' in Loretta Lynn's Lincoln'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
