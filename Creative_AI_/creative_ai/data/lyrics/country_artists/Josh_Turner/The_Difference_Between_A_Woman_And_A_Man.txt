(Bobby Braddock)

You talk about your feeling
Sometimes I keep mine to myself
But that doesn't mean your foolish
And you know I don't want anybody else
And you can say I love you
Like hello and goodbye.
Well I don't say it very often
But you know I'll love you till the day I die

That's just the difference
Between a woman and a man
Thank god for that difference
When we both understand
A woman and a man

I turn on like a light bulb
You warm up like an iron
And you might take a little longer
But your into it just as strong as I am

That's just the difference
Between a woman and a man
Thank god for that difference
When we both understand
A woman and a man

A woman and a man
A woman and a man''''''''''''''''''
