Darlin', it seems like the whole world's just turnin' so fast
Everything's changin' and we're just tryin' to keep up
But we've got something special here
Something worth waitin' for
Yeah, we're right on the edge of fallin'
Fallin' in love

No rush, no rush, ain't this world turnin', baby
Fast enough
Let's slow it on down to just the two of us
No rush

Walkin' (walkin') an' talkin' (talkin')
Dreamin' with you, wonderin' (wonderin')
And tell me baby, I've been wonderin'
Are you feelin' it too

No rush, no rush, we've got forever, baby
For catchin' up
Let's lay it on back to the speed of love
No rush

No rush, no rush, ain't this world turnin', baby
Fast enough
Let's slow it on down to just the two of us
No rush

No rush, no rush, we've got forever, baby
For catchin' up
Let's lay it on back to the speed of love
No rush
Let's slow it on down to just the two of us
No rush''''''''''''''''''
