She's as pretty as a model on TV
You've got to see her to believe me
That little lollipop will really make your jaw drop
You get to starin', you can't stop

Sweet as a honey bee hive
She got my attention from the get go
She goes a walkin' on by
She's a lookin' so fine
She's a little piece of eye candy

Oh, when the good Lord made that little looker
He must have used a whole lot of sugar
Maybe that's the reason that I crave her
So much flavor, all the time

Sweet as a honey bee hive
She got my attention from the get go
She goes a walkin' on by
She's a lookin' so fine
She's a little piece of eye candy

She gets me higher than anything can
She melts my heart when she's holding my hand

Let me tell you a little somthin' about her kisses
They ain't nutritious but they're delicious
If you're lookin' for a woman who's a goddess
Or the hottest, she's it

Sweet as a honey bee hive
She got my attention from the get go
She goes a walkin' on by
She's a lookin' so fine

She's as Sweet as a honey bee hive
She got my attention from the get go
She goes a walkin' on by
She's a lookin' so fine
She's a little piece of eye candy

Eye candy, yeah''''''''''''''''''
