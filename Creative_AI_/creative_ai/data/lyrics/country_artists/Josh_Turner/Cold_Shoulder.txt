If I'da lied, if I'da cheated, I'd understand
I've tried my best to be the perfect man
Now all I really wanna do is hold 'er
But all she's given me tonight is a cold shoulder

I wish that she would tell me what she's going through
Or go ahead and leave me if she's going to
But it's like she hasn't heard a word I've told 'er
All she's given me tonight is a cold shoulder

I don't know the woman she's turned into
But I do know that she's got my heart turning blue
The more she turns her back, the more the nights get colder
I put all the blame on her, cold shoulder

I wish that she would tell me what she's going through
Or go ahead and leave me if she's going to
But it's like she hasn't heard a word I've told 'er
All she's given me tonight is a cold shoulder

From the looks of fades it's looking like it's over
And all I've waited on tonight is a cold shoulder
Yea, all I've waited on tonight is a cold shoulder''''''''''''''''''
