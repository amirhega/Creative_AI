Ever since you caught my eye I can't get you off my mind
Girl, the way you move is driving me crazy
I don't mean to come on strong but I don't wanna wait too long
All I wanna do is make you my baby

Whatcha reckon we take off early today?
Go and take a little ride in my Chevrolet
Down the road we ain't been down before
And see where it goes

Whatcha reckon we lay it all on the line?
Take a chance and say what's on our mind
Girl, won't you let me hold you tight?
Whatcha reckon we fall in love tonight?

Knowing you is good for my heart and I knew it right from the start
I've never felt a feeling like this before
Ain't no sin in taking it slow, we can take our time when we get old
We can start right now with you and me walking out the door

Whatcha reckon we take off early today?
Go and take a little ride in my Chevrolet
Down the road we ain't been down before
And see where it goes

Whatcha reckon we lay it all on the line?
Take a chance and say what's on our mind
Girl, won't you let me hold you tight?
Whatcha reckon we fall in love tonight?

Hey whatcha reckon we lay it all on the line?
Take a chance and say what's on our mind
Girl, won't you let me hold you tight?
Whatcha reckon we fall in love tonight?

Girl, won't you let me hold you tight?
Whatcha reckon we fall in love tonight?''''''''''''''''''
