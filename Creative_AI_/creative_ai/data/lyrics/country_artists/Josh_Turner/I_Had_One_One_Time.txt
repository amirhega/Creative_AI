I sure do like your Cadillac
Brings lots of Memories back
I always felt like a star
Drivin' around in that car

'Cause I had one one time
Oh I had one one time
You probably think I'm lyin'
But I had One one time

Have you got a job that you love
Each day you can't wait to get up
You feel proud when you draw your pay
Would you be surprised if I say

That I had one one time
Oh I had one one time
Now I hold a cardboard sign
But I had one one time

I bet you've got a good friend
You always hang out on weekends
Since high school you've been as thick as thieves
Well, I bet you'd never believe

I had one one time
Oh, I had one one time
Somewhere along the line
I had one one time

That beautiful girl beside you is probably your wife
Man, you've got it all, I'd say you live quite a life

I had one one time
Oh, I had one one time
Maybe I've lost my mind
But I had one one time''''''''''''''''''
