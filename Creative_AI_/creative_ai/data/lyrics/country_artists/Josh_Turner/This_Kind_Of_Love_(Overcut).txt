I love the way it feels
To sit behind the wheel
Of a brand new automobile
I love the way
A song can start to play
And take you back to younger days

I've known that kind of love
You feel it for awhile and then its gone
But girl tonight
Holding you,
I realize that I've never known
This kind of love

Sometimes its hard
To let down your guard
And trust somebody with your heart
I know how
It feels when they walk out
And leave it in pieces on the ground

Oh I've known that kind of love
You feel it for awhile and then its gone
But girl tonight
Holding you
I realize that I've never known
This kind of love

It's deeper and stronger
And lasts a whole lot longer
It's more than a word that people say

Because I've known that kind of love
You feel it for awhile and then its gone
But girl tonight
Holding you
I realize that I've never known
This kind of love

This kind of love''''''''''''''''
