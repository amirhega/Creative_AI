Lady, let's go for a ride
I'll be more than happy to drive
Down an old country road
We can just take it slow
I just want you by my side

You want somebody to love you right and I can
I'm gonna be your left hand man

I'm gonna put a ring on your finger
We'll hire a wedding singer
Invite everybody in town

Put a good preacher in the middle
We'll make it official
We'll dance 'til the sun goes down

I can't wait to get to show off my wedding band
I'm gonna be your left hand man

I know it may sound kind of strange
But girl, let me try to explain
I wanna be a man you could count on
A shoulder you can cry on
I'll love you through anything

We'll get some rocking chairs and a house and a little bit of land 
I'm gonna be your left hand man

I'm gonna put a ring on your finger
We'll hire a wedding singer
Invite everybody in town

Put a good preacher in the middle
We'll make it official
We'll dance 'til the sun goes down

I can't wait to get to show off my wedding band
I'm gonna be your left hand man

I just want us to be together
Side by side forever
No matter where we are
Even when we're six feet under
They'll never have to wonder
If we ever drifted apart
This note took a lifetime
For you to really understand
That I'll always be your left hand man
Your left hand man
That's right''''''''''''''''''
