There's a slow moon rising
It's shining on your skin
The way your body moves me
I know there's no holding back, no holding back

I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this
I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you was anything I could resist
I'd have to be from another planet where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this

I can feel passion flowing
As you fall into my arms
The secret way you touch me
Tells me there's no holding back, no holding back

I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this
I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you was anything I could resist
I'd have to be from another planet where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel

Like roll with me, baby, all night long
Soul to soul with me, baby, all night long

No, I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this
I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you was anything I could resist
I'd have to be from another planet where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
