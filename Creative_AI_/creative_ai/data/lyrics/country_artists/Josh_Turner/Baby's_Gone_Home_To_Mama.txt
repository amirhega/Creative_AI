Rains comin' down on the roof of my trailer house
With my luck I'd probably step outside and drown
How long will it take to get used to this doin' without
Guess I'll just lay around in my pajamas
Baby's gone home to mama

Baby's gone home, she left me alone
But she said she'd phone me sometime
Sad old song, left me long gone outta my mind
Well, we did our best but we didn't have enough in common
Sittin' here lonesome, baby's gone home to mama

Glance through the paper lookin' for somethin' to read
Even the funnies weren't that funny to me
It's written in the stars the future was plain to see, yeah
Might've known she'd leave if I'd read Nostradomas
Baby's gone home to mama

Baby's gone home, she left me alone
But she said she'd phone me sometime
Sad old song, left me long gone outta my mind
Well, we did our best but we didn't have enough in common
Sittin' here lonesome, baby's gone home to mama

Y'all, I miss her alot but at least she took the little Chiwawa
Sittin' here lonesome, baby's gone home to mama
Baby's long gone, baby's gone home to mama
She's gone
Ah, sittin' here in my pajamas
My pajammies'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
