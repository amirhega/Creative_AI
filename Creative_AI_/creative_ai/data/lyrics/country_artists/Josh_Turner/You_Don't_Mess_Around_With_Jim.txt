Uptown's got its hustlers
The Bowery's got its bums
And forty second street got big Jim Walker
He's a pool shootin' son of a gun
Yeah, he's big and dumb as a man can come
But he's stronger than a country hoss
And when the bad folks all get together at night
You know they all call big Jim "boss"...just because

And they say
You don't tug on superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off the ol' Lone Ranger
And you don't mess around with Jim

Well, outta south Alabama came a country boy
He said, " I'm lookin' for a man named Jim
I am a pool shootin' boy
My name is Willie McCoy
But down home they call me slim
Yeah, I'm lookin' for the king of forty second street
He drivin' a drop top cadillac
And last week he took all my money
And it may sound funny
But I come to get my money back

And ev'rybody say
Jack, don't you know that
You don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off the ol' Lone ranger
And you don't mess around with Jim

Well, a hush fell over the pool room
When Jimmy come boppin' in off the street
And when the cuttin' was done
The only part that wasn't bloodyWas the soles f the big man's feet
Yeah, he was cut in 'bout a hundred places
And he was shot in a couple more
And you better believe
They sung a different kind of story
When big Jim hit the floor, uh huh

Now they say
You don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off the ol' Lone ranger
And you don't mess around with slim

Now they say
You don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off the ol' Lone ranger
And you don't mess around with slim

You don't pull the mask off the ol' Lone Ranger
You don't mess around with Slim'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
