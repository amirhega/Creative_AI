If you're looking for somebody you can talk to
When the heartache and the troubles overcome you
There's a man you can count on
That you can put your problems on

You've got questions, you need directions
Arms to hold you for all eternity
Look no further 'cause there's no other
For a lover and an understander
Jesus is the answer, Jesus is the answer

You're out there wondering
What got you into such a big old mess?
You've been feeling so undeserving of forgiveness
But there's a King upon a throne
That lets you know you're not alone

You've got questions, you need directions
Arms to hold you for all eternity
Look no further 'cause there's no other
He's an anchor, He's Gods right hander
Jesus is the answer, Jesus is the answer

Sometimes life is a no win situation
But get down on your knees
And He'll be right there waiting

You've got questions, you need directions
Arms to hold you for all eternity
Look no further 'cause there's no other
He's a lover and an understander
He's an anchor, He's Gods right hander
Jesus is the answer, Jesus is the answer
The answer

Jesus is the answer, Jesus is the answer
The answer''''''''''''''''''
