Just about a mile off o' Thirty One
There's a whole lot o' nothin' gettin' done
Blue-collar rednecks feeling fine
A couple o' sips of a year old shine
Everyday's about feeling good
Way down yonder in the trailerhood

Danny Ray's fishin' in his one-man boat
If he stayed gone no one would know
Darlene's boyfriend came home drunk
Ol' boy's luggage is loaded in the truck
That's one less two-timer up to no good
Way down yonder in the trailerhood

The trailerhood, the trailerhood
Ain't nobody doin' what they should
One thing is understood
You can be yourself in the trailerhood

If you wanna see a mobile home
Get turned into a honky tonk
Turn your truck south off o' Thirty One
Where the backwoods boys git-er-done
It's a single wide party box back in the woods
Way down yonder in the trailerhood

Yeah, the trailerhood, the trailerhood
Ain't nobody doin' what they should
One thing is understood
You can be yourself in the trailerhood

I said, the trailerhood, the trailerhood
Ain't nobody doin' what they should
One thing is understood
You can be yourself in the trailerhood

Yeah, you can be yourself in the trailerhood''''''''''''''''''
