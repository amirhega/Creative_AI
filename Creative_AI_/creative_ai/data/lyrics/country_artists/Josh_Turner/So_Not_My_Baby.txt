There's so many things
That I need to do
Seems like nothing gets done
When I'm feelin' so blue
And it's so hard to handle this absolute truth
That you're so not around and I'm so into you

You're so not my baby
It's making me crazy
It's breakin my heart
And my world half in two
You're so not my baby
Hey I should be okay
But ya know what
I'm so not
Over you

I keep ringin' and ringin' your old
Telephone seems like the
More that it rings
The more that you're gone
I oughta hang up and just let you go
But a voice in my heart
Keeps sayin' hello

You're so not my baby
It's making me crazy
It's breakin my heart


And my world half in two
You're so not my baby
Hey I should be okay
But ya know what
I'm so not
Over you

I've been searchin and searchin but it
Just get's me down
Cause your love and affection is
Nowhere to be found

You're so not my baby
It's making me crazy
It's breakin my heart
And my world half in two
You're so not my baby
Hey I should be okay
But ya know what
I'm so not
Over you

Know what
I'm so not
Over you

So not my baby

So not my baby''''''''''''''''''
