Your smile will always be one of my favorite things
Like backyard barbecues and front porch swings
An evening breeze through a window screen

Your smile makes me feel just like a child inside
Like Christmas morning sparkling red and bright
And grandpa's pie and my first bike

Your smile, like daylight dripping through the mountain pines
Pure sunshine, summertime
Your smile, like a wheat field in the southern breeze
Apple trees, sweet and ripe

Your smile, so much joy from such a simple thing
Like an old wheelbarrow filled with summer rain
A blue sky day and sun on my face
And your smile

Your smile, like daylight dripping through the mountain pines
Pure sunshine, summertime
Your smile like a wheat field in the southern breeze
Apple trees, sweet and ripe

Your smile, right there with buttered beans and cherry pie
And all the other simple joys of life
That warm my heart and make it all worthwhile
Your smile''''''''''''''''''
