Would you go with me 
If we rolled down streets of fire
Would you hold on to me tighter 
As the summer sun got higher
If we roll from town to town 
And never shut it down

Would you go with me 
If we were lost in fields of clover
Would we walk even closer 
Until the trip was over
And would it be okay 
If I didn't know the way

If I gave you my hand, would you take it
And make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute 
Without you, girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Let me know if you're really a dream
I love you so, so would you go with me

Would you go with me 
If we rode the clouds together
Could you not look down forever
If you were lighter than a feather
Oh, and if I set you free
Would you go with me

If I gave you my hand, would you take it
And make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute 
Without you, girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Help me tie up the ends of a dream
I gotta know, would you go with me
I love you so, so would you go with me''''''''''''''''''
