I grew up workin' on a farm, way down South
I went to school against my will, way down South
I kissed girls and I shot squirrels out behind my house
I learned a lot about this world, way down South

I went to church, sang a lot of hymns, way down South
I learned to work on my pickup truck, way down South
I played my guitar under the stars, out behind our house
You will always find my heart, way down South

Clothes on a clothes line, hangin' in the sunshine
A garden growin' in the ground
Country music on the radio, talk about a good ol' sound
People drivin' pass when I'm cuttin' grass
Wavin' at every single one
That's the way it's done when you come from, way down South
Way down South

Swimmin' in the creek with all my friends, way down South
Prayin' them days would never end, way down South
Give me a worm and a fishin' pole, I'll pull a fish on out
Those memories will never get old, way down South

Clothes on a clothes line, hangin' in the sunshine
A garden growin' in the ground
Country music on the radio, talk about a good ol' sound
People drivin' pass when I'm cuttin' grass
Wavin' at every single one
That's the way it's done when you come from, way down South
That's the way it's done when you come from, way down South
Way down South, way down South
Yeah, way on down''''''''''''''''''
