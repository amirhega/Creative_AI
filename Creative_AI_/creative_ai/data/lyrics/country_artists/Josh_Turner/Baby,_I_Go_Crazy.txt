Every time you shake your hips
Baby, I go crazy
When you kiss me on my lips
Baby, I go crazy
When you call me on the phone
Your sexy talking turns me on
You make it tough just holding on
You got me going crazy
Baby, I go crazy

I see it coming and I can't help myself
You give me loving like nobody else
You got me falling now, I'm calling for help
Girl, I'm going crazy

When you put on that party dress
Baby, I go crazy
You got me hooked, I must confess

You got me going crazy
Baby, I go crazy

I see it coming and I can't help myself
You give me loving like nobody else
You got me falling now, I'm calling for help
Girl, I'm going crazy
Baby, I go crazy

I see it coming and I can't help myself
You give me loving like nobody else
You got me falling now, I'm calling for help
Girl, I'm going crazy

You really know how to drive me wild
Baby, I go crazy
Crawling 'round just like a child
Baby, I go crazy
Darlin', I go crazy
Baby, I go crazy''''''''''''''''''
