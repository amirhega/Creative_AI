Funny thing about a small town
Your life goes by as you're drivin' out
The house you were livin' in the barn that we did it in
Girl I just wanna forget it now
Never thought a couple headlights would light up a town so bright
Our names a little faded in the saddle we painted makes me baby wanna turn around

Hey this town is too much you for me
I can't live around all these memories
I see you everywhere I look it's somethin' I don't wanna see
Girl this town is too much you for me

Just passed X of 25 we used to slip out there
Friday night watchin' the sun go down with the radio loud
Drownin' out the sound of being turned on
I thought those days would never end
But lookin' back now they sure did
I was still livin' it every night every minute
And girl I swear I gotta move on

Hey this town is too much you for me
I can't live around all these memories
I see you everywhere I look it's somethin' I don't wanna see
Girl this town is too much you for me

Hey this town is too much you for me
I can't live around all these memories
I see you everywhere I look it's somethin' I don't wanna see
Girl this town is too much you for me

Is too much you for me''''''''''''''''
