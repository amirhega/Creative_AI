I make you laugh and tell you things
You start thinking this is more than what it really is
You're beginning to dream and maybe someday
You could be the angel that could make me change
But all I see is a storm that you'll get lost in
'Cause if it feels this good when we're just talkin'

You should be walking away, walking away
As far as you can go, as fast as you can.
You don't know it but you oughta be walking away, walking away
From me baby
Instead of tryin' to save me
You oughta be walking away

You're standing there, in your party dress
And there ain't no doubt about it darlin' I'm impressed
But I see you and I know me.
I'd say right now that I'm the last thing that you need
But girl don't get me wrong, I'd sure love to do this
But somewhere in my heart I know the truth is

You ought to be walking away, walking away
As far as you can go, as fast as you can.
You don't know it but you oughta be walking away, walking away
From me baby
Instead of tryin' to save me
You oughta be walking away

You should be walking away, walking away
As far as you can go, as fast as you can.
You don't know it but you oughta be walking away, walking away
From me baby
Instead of tryin' to save me
You oughta be walking away''''''''''''''''''
