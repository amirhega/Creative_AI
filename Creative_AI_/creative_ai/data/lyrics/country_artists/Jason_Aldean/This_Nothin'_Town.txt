Got us a sunset sinking into a Friday night
Got us some beer needs drinking hey and we just might
Sometimes we gotta make it up as we go
But layin' low ain't all that goes on 'round here

It might look a little laid back to ya
But it ain't all just porches and plows
But don't let that one red light fool ya
There's always something going down
In this nothing town

That old abandoned factory just got the wrecking ball
We threw a party in the parking lot just to watch it fall
Sometimes we gotta make it up as we go
But laying low ain't all that goes on round here

It might look a little laid back to ya
But it ain't all just porches and plows
But don't let that one red light fool ya
There's always something going down
In this nothing town
In this nothing town

Somebody's backyard
Some river bank
Sometimes c'mon y'all
Yeah that's all it takes

It might look a little laid back to ya
But it ain't all just porches and plows
But don't let that one red light fool ya
There's always something going down
In this nothing town

There's something going down
In this nothing town'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
