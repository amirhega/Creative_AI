I'm about as small town as you can get 
I'm talkin' two lanes one cop
Plowed up fields catching red sunsets 
We get nervous when the rain stops 
Never had a reason to leave this place 
Never had a reason to get away

The wheels just touched down in California 
Man I don't even like to fly 
I just gotta see her with the sun shining on her in the water 
Chrome aviators on her eyes 

I never had a reason to get away 
I never had a reason to see this place 
She gave me a reason to love L.A.

She said she had to be where that sun dropped down 
I'm talkin' fast lane goodbye 
She'd chase it all the way till that road ran out 
And parked it underneath the pink sky 
I wanna hear those waves come crashing in
I wanna feel that sand and that wind 
I wanna go everywhere she's been, hold her again

The wheels just touched down in California 
Man I don't even like to fly 
I just gotta see her with the sun shining on her in the water 
Chrome aviators on her eyes 

I never had a reason to get away 
I never had a reason to see this place...

The wheels just touched down in California 
Man I don't even like to fly 
I just gotta see her with the sun shining on her in the water 
Chrome aviators on her eyes 

I never had a reason to get away 
I never had a reason to see this place 
She gave me a reason to love L.A.'''''''''''''''''''''''
