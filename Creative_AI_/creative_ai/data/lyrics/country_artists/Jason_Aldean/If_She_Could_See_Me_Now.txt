There wasn't a stone I didn't throw
When I wrecked it
My foolish words so cruel and cold
Were disconnected

Tell me why, when she cried
All I did was close my eyes

But if she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now

Now the sunshine feels like rain
Trying to drown me
And the world feels out of place
All around me

So I wait and I pray
That I'll run into her someday

But if she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now

There's so many things
I wish I could tell her, show her
Just how bad I really need her
Miss her, love her

But if she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now

But if she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now

If she could see me now''''''''''''''''''
