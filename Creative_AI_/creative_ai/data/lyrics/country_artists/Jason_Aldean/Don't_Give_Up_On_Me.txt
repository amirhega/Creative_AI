I don't go to church enough,
I curse out loud I drink too much,
I'm more of a sinner than a saint,
Gotta dusty bible on my shelf,
I just pick it up when I need help,
Lord knows there's a lot I need to change,
And I want to baby you make me want to,

You tie the knot when I'm at the end of my rope,
You never stop believing in me when I don't know,
Who I am or what I'm supposed to be,
I don't give you no good reasons,
But baby don't give up on me,

I've smoked my last cigarette,
At least a hundred times I bet,
I guess I'll just keep quitting till it sticks,
But for all the things I've failed to do,
I've never failed at loving you,
We both know I can't grant your every wish,
But I want to baby you make me want to,'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
