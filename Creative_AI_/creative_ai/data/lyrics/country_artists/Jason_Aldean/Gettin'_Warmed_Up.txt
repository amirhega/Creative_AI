Let's go

We showed up here when the sun went down
Hit it hard, kicked it off right
You think by now we'd be heading out
Hanging it up and calling it a nigh

But we're just gettin' warmed up
Just gettin' started
Already fired up, yeah this party
Ain't nothin' like it round here
Going down out here
Another double shot of crazy in a cup
And we're just gettin' warmed up
Yeah we're just gettin' warmed up

This midnight smoke, it ain't burning out
'Cause this party crowd's been waiting all week
The way we got it a-rolling now
It's going fast, and picking up steam

And we're just gettin' warmed up
Just gettin' started
Already fired up, yeah this party
Ain't nothin' like it round here
Going down out here
Another double shot of crazy in a cup
And we're just gettin' warmed up
Yeah we're just gettin' warmed up

You'd think by now we'd be rolling now
But we're just picking up steam

Yeah we're just gettin' warmed up
Just gettin' started
Already fired up, yeah this party
Ain't nothin' like it round here
Going down out here

Gettin' warmed up and gettin' started
Everybody in here came to party
You need a good time, well I brought it
Hands upon the air if you want it
Yeah the speakers are here and they turned up
Cups filling, we mixed up the good stuff
Who's setting it off, you know that's us
You already know, we gettin' warmed up

We're just gettin' warmed up
Just gettin' started
Already fired up, yeah this party
Ain't nothin' like it round here
Going down out here
Another double shot of crazy in a cup
And we're just gettin' warmed up
Yeah we're just gettin' warmed up
We're just gettin' warmed up
We're just gettin' warmed up'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
