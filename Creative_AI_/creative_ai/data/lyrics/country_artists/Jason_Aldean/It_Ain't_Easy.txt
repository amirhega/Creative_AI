I walk a hard line winding road
Don't really know where it's gonna go
Seems like trouble's my best friend
Soon as I get out I'm back in again
It's a wonder I ain't all alone

'Cause it ain't easy, no, it ain't easy
It ain't easy loving me

Don't know why I do the things I do
Must be I love to light the fuse
Stand back and watch it crash and burn and turn into ash
Just like it ain't nothing, she ain't something I could lose

'Cause it ain't easy, no, it ain't easy
It ain't easy loving me

She's the brick by brick that built this house
Without her it would all fall down
Somehow she finds the faith and the strength to believe
Don't know why she sticks around

'Cause it ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy loving me
'Cause it ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy loving me'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
