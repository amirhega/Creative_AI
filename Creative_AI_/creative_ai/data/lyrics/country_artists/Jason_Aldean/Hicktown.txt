You like the way that sounds?

Little Jimmy Jackson is jackin' up his Bronco
He's gonna lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull
And all the girls are getting pretty sprayin' on the White Rain
Yeah they're gonna get a-rowdy tonight down at the football game
Yeah

We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild yeah but that's the way we get down
In a hick town

Well you can see the neighbors buttcrack nailing on his shingles
And his woman's smokin' Pall Malls watchin' Laura Ingalls
And Granny's getting' lit she's headin' out to bingo
Yeah my buddies and me are goin' muddin' down on Blue Hole Road
You know, you know?

We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild yeah but that's the way we get down
In a hick town

We hear folks in the city party in martini bars
And they like to show off in their fancy foreign cars
Out here in the boondocks we buy beer at Amoco
And crank our Kraco speakers with that country radio

We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild yeah but that's the way we get down
Oh oh we let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It's buck wild yeah but that's the way we get down
In a hick town
In a hick town
It's the way we get down
In a hick town
Yeah in a hick town

Oh we ain't finished yet
We got your country boys and your redneck girls
It's the party heard 'round the world
Right here in hick town
Yeah in hick town
The whole town's gettin' down''''''''''''''''''
