The mention of your name
That's all it takes
My heart re-breaks
My whole world shakes
And it's flashback driveway pouring rain
Nothing I could do nothing I could say
To slow you down
And right now

It's like the first time watching you walk away
Begging baby please just stay
Feeling every second of the clock tick by
On an endless night
The first time seeing you with someone new
Dying inside trying to play it cool
It don't matter how long it's been
I'm always missing you
For the first time again

It could start with an old song
Feeling you come on
It could be at a party
Seeing everybody
And I'm right back wishing you were right back here
Wishing that missing you would just disappear
But it don't and it won't
And baby here I go

It's like the first time watching you walk away
Begging baby please just stay
Feeling every second of the clock tick by
On an endless night
The first time seeing you with someone new
Dying inside trying to play it cool
It don't matter how long it's been
I'm always missing you
For the first time again
Oh, for the first time again

It don't let up, it don't get better
Hell it just might last forever
But it all takes me back
It all takes me back

To the first time watching you walk away
Begging baby please just stay
Feeling every second of the clock tick by
On an endless night
The first time seeing you with someone new
Dying inside trying to play it cool
It don't matter how long it's been
I'm always missing you
For the first time again
I'm always missing you
For the first time again
For the first time again'''''''''''''''''''''''
