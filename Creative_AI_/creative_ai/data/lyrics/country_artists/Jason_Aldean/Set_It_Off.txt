Got a warm breeze blowing, cool creek flowing
Full moon high, got a good thing going
Got some old school tracks tweaking on the speakers
What we got between us is burning like a fever
It's a damn good night, firefly light, bourbon on ice
Just waiting on you and I to

Set it off, set if off
A little kiss is all it takes, all it takes to get me lit
And I'll be like a bottle rocket flying
Every move striking like lighting
That 5 alarm touch in your fingertips
Turns an ordinary night into a night like this
Let's set it off, set it off
Set it off

We were hanging on 8, now we're tipping on 10
You turn it up a little then you turn it up again
The curves on you got my body on cruise
You're 90 proof smooth but girl them baby blues really

Set it off, set if off
A little kiss is all it takes, all it takes to get me lit
And I'll be like a bottle rocket flying
Every move striking like lighting
That 5 alarm touch in your fingertips
Turns an ordinary night into a night like this
Let's set it off, set it off
Set it off

On your mark, get set, go
Give the stars a little rock show
Set fire to this back road
Make midnight into smoke

Set it off, set if off
A little kiss is all it takes, all it takes to get me lit
And I'll be like a bottle rocket flying
Every move striking like lighting
That 5 alarm touch in your fingertips
Turns an ordinary night into a night like this
Let's set it off, set it off
Set it off

Set it off
Yeah girl, set it off''''''''''''''''''
