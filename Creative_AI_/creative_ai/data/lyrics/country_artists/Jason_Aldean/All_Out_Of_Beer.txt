If you'd a got here 'fore my buzz kicked in
I'd a told you where to go, I'd a never let you in
Crashed out on the couch waitin' on that sun to come up
I'd probably still be hating on you
Saying I'm just glad it's over, actin' like that was the truth
I'd still have my walls, girl, I wouldn't care at all

So why you gotta wait until I'm gone to come around
When I ain't got no fight left I got no way out
When I'm 12 in, helpless
The only time you show up here is when you're lonely
And I'm all out of beer

I wish that you'd go find somebody new
And I wish I had it in me, to just have one or two
I wish I could draw a line, stick to it just one time
But I'm drunk tonight, so never mind

So why you gotta wait until I'm gone to come around
When I ain't got no fight left I got no way out
When I'm 12 in, helpless
The only time you show up here is when you're lonely
And I'm all out of beer

You got me where you want me girl, no I can't stand it
Looks like tonight's gonna go just the way you planned it

So why you gotta wait until I'm gone to come around
When I ain't got no fight left I got no way out
When I'm 12 in, helpless
The only time you show up here
Is when I'm 12 in, helpless
Girl you know I'm gonna give in
When you're lonely
And I'm all out of beer
When you're lonely
And I'm all out of beer'''''''''''''''''''''''
