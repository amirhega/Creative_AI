Nobody ever thought I'd make it in this town
They all said I should leave my truck packed and turn right back around
They said I didn't have what it takes,
I needed money and a pretty face
But I just look at them and say:

I use what I got
Take what I get
Give till I ain't got nothin' left
Then I give it some more
Keep on climbin up that mountain
Keep trucking along
Work up a sweat
Passed every no, after no, after no, till I get a yes.
I'm not worried about what I'm not.
I use what I got.

I still got big dreams and a strong heart,
I got a lot of real good friends who helped me get this far.
I still got a lot of miles to go,
It's a winding uphill road.
But I'll get there the only way I know.

Keep on rollin' along
Doin' my best
Passed every no, after no, after no, till I get a YES!
I don't worry about what I'm not
No, No
I don't worry about what I'm not
I use what I got!''''''''''''''''''
