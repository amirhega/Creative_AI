I found a box of memories
Read a letter dropped a tear where you signed your name
And turnin' the page smearing the ink and the love always
Girl I always start this way
Then I end up in a bottle screaming out your name
And punching the walls, carrying on like I've gone insane
In the mirror I can see the man that just shook his head with no remorse
Watched an angel crying tears packing all her things as she walked out the door

Cause there ain't nothing like a memory
When it's coming on strong like a hurricane
How can love like that just up and walk away
It's killing me baby
It's got me pouring up another drink
Bourbons hittin me hard like a freight train
With my back against a wall or on my knees
When the worst of your memory gets the best of me

I remember it all too well
Riding 441 down to Milledgeville
Crossing the bridge as the sun set on lake St. Claire
I couldn't wait to see your smile but all I saw was tears in your pretty eyes
That said it all, it was all down hill from there
And I remember you saying baby please don't give up on me
All but baby this stubborn man is gonna line the bed he made

Cause there ain't nothing like a memory
When it's coming on strong like a hurricane
How can love like that just up and walk away
It's killing me baby
It's got me pouring up another drink
Bourbons hittin me hard like a freight train
With my back against a wall or on my knees
When the worst of your memory gets the best of me

Cause there ain't nothing like a memory
When it's coming on strong like a hurricane
How can love like that just up and walk away
It's killing me baby
It's got me pouring up another drink
Bourbons hittin me hard like a freight train
With my back against a wall or on my knees
When the worst of your memory gets the best of me''''''''''''''''''
