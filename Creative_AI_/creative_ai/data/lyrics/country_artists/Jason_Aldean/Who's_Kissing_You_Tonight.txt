I don't think of you every day and night
I got things to do, yeah I'm doing all right
So, I can't explain why in times like these
I nearly go insane when you're not here with me
Oh I know it's really over and you're never coming back
And there's no way that I can make it right
Still I wonder, oh I wonder, oh baby I can't but wonder
Who's kissing you tonight?

Oh it's the jealousy that's hurting me
So why can't I let it be, why can't I just let go?
But the thought of you somewhere with someone else


Doing what we used to do, feeling what we felt
Oh I know it's really over and you're never coming back
And there's no way that I can make it right
Still I wonder, oh I wonder, oh baby I can't but wonder
Who's kissing you tonight?

Oh I know it's really over and you're never coming back
And there's no way that I can make it right
Still I wonder, oh I wonder, oh baby I can't but wonder
Who's kissing you... Who's kissing tonight?
Who's holding you tight? Aw, Who's kissing you tonight?'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
