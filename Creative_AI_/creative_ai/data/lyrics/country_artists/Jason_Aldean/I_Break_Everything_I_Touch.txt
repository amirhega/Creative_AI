If it's gonna happen, then it's gonna happen
That's just the way that it is
Oh love comes along and it don't take long
Till it slips through my fingertips
I could make some excuses, but darlin' the truth is
I'm just the reckless kind
And I don't wanna leave you to pick up the pieces
Oh no matter how I try

Girl, I break everything I touch
Little girl that's close enough
Seems like every heart I've ever loved
I break everything I touch

I can't look in your eyes and tell you a lie
I'd love to leave here with you
Oh but darlin' the fact is
I'm always atracted to everything I shouldn't do
Oh so you better know, before I lose control


Before we throw it all to chance
Girl your welcome to stay, but all I've got to say
Before you lay your heart in my hands

Yeah I break everything I touch
Little girl that's close enough
Seems like every heart I've ever loved
I break everything I touch

Well I break everything I touch
Little girl that's close enough
Seems like every heart I've ever loved
I break everything I touch

Yeah I break everything I touch
Little girl that's close enough
Seems like every heart I've ever loved
I break everything I touch''''''''''''''''''
