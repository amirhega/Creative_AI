Well she walked into the joint...
Lookin' like a million dollars...
From the brim of a Stetson hat...
To the heels of her Tony Llamas...
She said hey Mr. tall dark and handsome cowboy man...
Would you like to dance with me...
And I said hey pretty cowboy lady...
I gotta little girl at home thinks the world of me...
Well I could tell by the look in her eyes... She didn't take rejection easily...
So I said hey pretty cowboy lady...
Let me tell you what I mean...

Well my baby, when she loves me...
She makes me feel like a king...
Well my baby she's my beauty queen...
And when she's lovin' me, she wears a crown...

She said, hey Mr. tall dark and handsome cowboy man...
Just one thing I don't understand...
You see if you're baby really loves you...
Well tell me where is your weddin band...

And I said hey pretty cowboy lady,
There's more to that you don't understand...
You see when your baby really loves you loves you loves you loves you...
It ain't through no weddin band...
And well I could tell by the look in her eyes...
She was beginning to understand...
So I said hey pretty cowboy lady...
Let me tell you once again...

Well my baby, when she loves me...
She makes me feel like a king...
Well my baby, she's my beauty queen...
And when she's lovin' me, She wears a crown...

Whoa my baby, when she loves me...

Well my baby she's my beauty queen...
But when she's lovin' me she wears a crown...
