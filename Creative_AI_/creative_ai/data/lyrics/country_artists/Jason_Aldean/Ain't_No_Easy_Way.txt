There ain't no easy way
For me to hear the things you need to say
But go on and say 'em anyway
Baby I can take it

There ain't no easy out
We both know where this is goin' now
Once its rollin' you can't turn around
There ain't no way to fake it

Life is hard but love is harder
And when love won't go any farther
Tears won't put it back together
Sorry don't make it no better
When you run out of ways to stay

There ain't no easy way
To look somebody in the face
And tell them your feelings have changed
And you can't do it anymore
The ain't no easy way
You can try to keep on tryin'
Act like love ain't really dyin'
You can just hang on for so long
You can only be just so strong
When you've run out of ways to stay
There ain't no easy way
For me to hear the things you need to say
But go on and say 'em anyway
Baby I can take it
Baby I can take it

There ain't no easy way''''''''''''''''''''''''
