Going through my closet the other day
Found an old yearbook, flipped right to the page
Of that senior trip down there on that Panama strip
We all started yelling when we smelled the beach
Just couldn't wait to try our fake ids
We only had a few days, and a whole lot of memories to make
Oh man we were livin', didn't waste one minute
We talked and drank and danced and said goodbye
We laughed until we cried

This past year my family
Was sittin' cross-legged 'round the Christmas tree
Listenin to granddad, we all knew it would probably be his last
He was crackin' jokes and we were takin' turns
Tellin' stories bout fishing or lessons learned
Out on the porch with him we all felt like kids again

Oh man we were livin', sittin' there reminiscin'
Yeah, we sang and talked and traveled back in time


We laughed until we cried

It's like the best days under the sun
Every emotion rolled into one
A little of this, A little of that
Kinda happy, Kinda sad

Just the other night the baby was cryin
So I got out of bed rocked her awhile and I held her tight
And I told her it would be all right
My mind went back to a few years ago
We tried so long, we almost gave up hope
And I remember you comin' in and tellin' me the news
Oh man we were livin', goin' crazy in the kitchen
We danced and screamed and held each other tight
We laughed until we cried
(Although, the CD cover says Oh man were livin' I'll never forget it,
We danced and kissed and thanked the Lord that night)''''''''''''''''
