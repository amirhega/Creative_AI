I've always been there every time he let you down
I caught your falling tears before they hit the ground
But I just heard somebody say that you finally told him goodbye
Well girl now you've finally made your move
Now I'm here to make mine...

I want to be there when you wake up, be more than just your friend
Baby there's no mistaking you're the love I wanna be in

I've kept my feelings under lock and key
Couldn't let you see them even though it was killing me
You can't imagine all the time I spent wishing you were mine
I just know if we ever kissed we'd go crazy baby for the rest of our lifes

I want to be there when you wake up, be more than just your friend
Baby there's no mistaking you're the love I wanna be in!

Well I want to be there when you wake up
Be more than just your friend
Baby there's no mistaking you're the love I wanna be in!

I wanna be there when you wake up, be more than just your friend
Baby there's no mistaking, you're the love I wanna be in!
You're the love I wanna be in!
Oh yeah

I wanna be there when you wake up...'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
