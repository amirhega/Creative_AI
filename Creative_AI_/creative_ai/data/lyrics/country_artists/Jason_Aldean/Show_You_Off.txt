We can go around, club hopping
Tell you all I want to do is drop in
Have a drink and catch a good band
Couple songs and, hey, we're gone again
Act like that's all we're doing, the truth is...

I just wanna show you off
Drive 'em all crazy,
Watch all the boys hate me
Is that so wrong? Come on
I just want the world to see how lucky I am
You're so fine girl, damn,
Be all I ever saw
I just want to show you off

Maybe take a ride down Broadway
All the Dodges and the Fords and the Chevrolets
Slow rolling, looking over and
Girl, you've got that super cab glowing
Roll down that tinted window
There you go.

I just wanna show you off
Drive 'em all crazy,
Watch all the boys hate me
Is that so wrong? Come on
I just want the world to see how lucky I am
You're so fine girl, damn,
Be all I ever saw,
I just want to show you off

(Come on, girl)

Might look like we're just cruising, truth is, truth is...

I just wanna show you off
Drive 'em all crazy,
Watch all the boys hate me
Is that so wrong? Come on
I just want the world to see how lucky I am
You're so fine girl, damn,
Be all I ever saw
I just wanna show you off
I just wanna show you off''''''''''''''''''
