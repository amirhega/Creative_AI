These fields don't grow overnight
This town wasn't built in a day
I'll be turnin' that dirt when the sun comes up
Goin' 'round in circles while that plane
You're on takes you away
Chasin' down that sun in L.A.
Two thousand miles, it ain't that far
Girl, wherever you are

I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you
Find your way back, I pray you do
I'll wait for you
The August rain, the break of dawn
Like anything worth countin' on
Comin' through
I'll wait for you

I'll keep the light on on the porch
I'll keep the key under the mat
Just in case I'm out there somewhere
Tryin' not to lose my mind
And you come back, I know, you gotta go
And if you don't, girl, you'll never know
And if you can't find what you want out there
I'll be right here, ain't goin' nowhere

I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you
Find your way back, I pray you do
I'll wait for you
The August rain, the break of dawn
Like anything worth countin' on
Comin' through
I'll wait for you
Oh, I'll wait for you

These fields don't grow overnight
This town wasn't built in a day
Some things you love are worth the wait
Worth the wait

I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you
Find your way back, I pray you do
I'll wait for you
The August rain, the break of dawn
Like anything worth countin' on
Comin' through
I'll wait for you
Oh, I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
Oh, I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
