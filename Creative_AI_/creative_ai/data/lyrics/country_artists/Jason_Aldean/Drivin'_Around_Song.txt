This is for everybody out there, circling the town square,
Proud to be stuck out in the middle of nowhere
USA, Chevrolet, Dodge and Ford, rising a little hell and praising the Lord

Just simple truth speaking, looking for the weekend
Every time it hits the fan you just keep on keeping
You try the truth, red white and blue
Turn it up, turn it up, man, this one's for you

Hey, this is for the driving around, Jack and Diane town, anywhere Saturday night
Yeah, yeah, this is for the back road, turning up the radio, heading right
Where the two lane turns into main street, cruising the same streets,
Over in the passenger seat
Baby ain't never looked better just singing along,
To this driving around song

Yeah, I know what I'm talking about, I grew up in the low rams
Cout down them days, 'til I got brave enough to bust out
City lights in my size, I'm gonna do it upright,
I'm sitting here with this guitar tonight
Kickin' it in the big town, wishing I'd have slowed it down
And I give anything if I was driving around with the big dreams in my pocket
Yeah, this is for the ones who don't know how good they got it

Hey, this is for the driving around, Jack and Diane town, anywhere Saturday night
Yeah, yeah, this is for the back road, turning up the radio, heading right
Where the two lane turns into main street, cruising the same streets,
Over in the passenger seat
Baby ain't never looked better just singing along,
To this driving around song

Alright, everybody,
Get in your truck, get in your car, whatever it is
Small town America, baby,
We're going drive it around

Hey, this is for the driving around, Jack and Diane town, anywhere Saturday night
Yeah, yeah, this is for the back road, turning up the radio, heading right
Where the two lane turns into main street, cruising the same streets,
Over in the passenger seat
Baby ain't never looked better just singing along,
To this driving around song
To this driving around song
To this driving around song''''''''''''''''''''''''
