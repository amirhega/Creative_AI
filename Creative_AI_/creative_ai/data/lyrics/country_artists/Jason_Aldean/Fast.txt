Goodbye crack of dawn,
Goodbye harvester,
And goodbye hello baby,
After a long hard day,
Of plowing dirt,

Goodbye way of life,
Goodbye pass it down,
Goodbye up all night,
Of praying for rain,
A two year drought,
Walking on faith,
And toughing it out,

Hey,
What's past is past,
Oh,
Nothing in this world lasts,
Hey,
Aren't those four lanes,
Fast,

Goodbye gravel road,
Thanks for the ride,
For watching over me,
Remember the time,
I rolled my truck,
And you were there,
When I woke up,
You walked me home,
Yeah you lead me home

Goodbye,
Tomorrows another day,
In no time,
It only moves one way,
Away from yesterday,
Oh memories never fade,

Aren't they fast,
What's past is past,
Aren't they fast,''''''''''''''''''
