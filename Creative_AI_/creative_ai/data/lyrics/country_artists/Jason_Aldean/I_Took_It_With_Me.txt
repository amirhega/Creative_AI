When I passed that city limits sign
I knew that I was finally on my own
So I put my foot down on the gas
To see how fast those wheels could get me gone
Everything about that place made me who I am
They say once you leave
You can't go back again

So I took it with me
That cloud of red dust rollin' up
That Georgia blue sky settin' sun
Straight up Highway 41
I took it with me
That wild streak
That fightin' side
That born to run on Friday night
That standing tall small town pride
I took it with me

Well they say this world can change you fast
Kick you right on back where you belong
So I roll my sleeves up everyday
And that's just what you do where I come from
Everything I ever knew I bottled up inside
When I need a shot of back home
It ain't hard to find

So I took it with me
That cloud of red dust rollin' up
That Georgia blue sky settin' sun
Straight up Highway 41
I took it with me
That wild streak
That fightin' side
That born to run on Friday night
That standing tall small town pride
I took it with me

I might be a thousand miles away
But it's still crystal clear
I see that picture in my mind
And I keep it right here

'Cause I took it with me
That cloud of red dust rollin' up
That Georgia blue sky settin' sun
Straight up Highway 41
I took it with me
That wild streak
That fightin' side
That born to run on Friday night
That standing tall small town pride
I took it with me

Yeah, yeah

I took it with me
Oh, I took it with me''''''''''''''''''
