I've never been superstitious
I've never feared the unknown
But ever since you left me
I've believed in ghosts
Girl, I believe in ghosts

Well I'm haunted by a memory
That won't leave or let me go
Call me crazy and I may be
But I believe in ghosts
Girl, I believe in ghosts

I swear I keep seeing shadows
I know that I'm not alone
I feel the temperature dropping
And it chills me to the bone

Well I'm haunted by a memory
That won't leave or let me go
Call me crazy and I may be
But I believe in ghosts
Girl, I believe in ghosts

Should I be afraid, should I be scared
You follow me everywhere, I'm haunted

Call me crazy hell I may be
But I believe in ghosts

Well I'm haunted by a memory
That won't leave or let me go
Call me crazy and I may be
But I believe in ghosts
Girl, I believe in ghosts

I've never been superstitious
I've never feared the unknown
But ever since you left me baby
I've believed in ghosts''''''''''''''''''
