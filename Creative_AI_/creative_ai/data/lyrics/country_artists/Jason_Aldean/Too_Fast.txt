I want to be the man that you thought I was
I want to be the man that made you fall in love
I can't undo everything I've done
But let me tell you right now
Baby, you're the only one

I don't want to be a restless soul
Runnin' on empty, burnin' up the road
Never knowin' what I'm tryin' to find
While the wheels keep turnin' in the back of my mind
I don't wanna take a long way home
Sleepin' in a roadside room alone
Head in the clouds, foot on the gas, livin' my life too fast

I've been makin' a livin', not makin' a life
And knowin' that now, well it cuts like a knife
The way it's been ain't how it's gonna be
Baby, startin' right now, gonna give you the best of me

I don't want to be a restless soul
Runnin' on empty, burnin' up the road
Never knowin' what I'm tryin' to find
While the wheels keep turnin' in the back of my mind
I don't wanna take a long way home
Sleepin' in a roadside room alone
Head in the clouds, foot on the gas, livin' my life too fast

Ooh, I've been a rollin' stone
I think it's time for me to roll on home

I don't want to be a restless soul
Runnin' on empty, burnin' up the road
Never knowin' what I'm tryin' to find
While the wheels keep turnin' in the back of my mind
I don't want to take the long way home
Sleepin' in a roadside room alone
Head in the clouds, foot on the gas, livin' my life too fast

Livin' my life too fast''''''''''''''''''
