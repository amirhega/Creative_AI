Twelve gauge '04 buckshot floorboard, don't ask
Fence post, door dent, let's just leave it at that
It's got dirt on me, yeah I'd be up a creek

If my truck could talk, I'd have to yank out all the wires
Pour on the gas, set it on fire, anything to shut it up
It's been good to me, but it knows too much, it's seen it all
I'd have to find a riverbank and roll it off
If my truck could talk

Those two headlights looked in her eyes, while she danced
Moonlit truck bed, two kids, enough said, yeah man
All that went on, those all night longs
It could go on and on and on

If my truck could talk, I'd have to yank out all the wires
Pour on the gas, set it on fire, anything to shut it up
It's been good to me, but it knows too much, it's seen it all
I'd have to find a riverbank and roll it off
If my truck could talk

If my truck could talk, I couldn't deny a word it said
I'd just smile and shake my head, yeah

It's been good to me, but it knows too much, it's seen it all
I'd have to find a riverbank and roll it off
If my truck could talk, if my truck could talk
If my truck could talk''''''''''''''''''
