One horse town, restless soul
Wondering where the river and the freight trains go
Two lane road, hometown roots
We're never gonna hold back my goodbye boots
Just waiting on ready or not
You know the first chance I got

I got blacktop gone, four lane fast
Topping off the tank with some never look back
Chase that sun, race that wind
With them horses that you can't fence in
Free like a freeway, high on a highway
Packing up a getaway soul
Getting blacktop gone

Girl you look like you might
Do a little running out on the wild side
I bet that kiss could slow me down
But if you're looking for Mr. Stick Around
That ain't me
It's like I'm born to be

Blacktop gone, four lane fast
Topping off the tank with some never look back
Chase that sun, race that wind
With them horses that you can't fence in
Free like a freeway, high on a highway
Packing up a getaway soul
Getting blacktop gone

I'm just a good to go, one night show
I'm ready to rock 'til I'm ready to roll

And get blacktop gone, four lane fast
Topping off the tank with some never look back
Chase that sun, race that wind
With them horses that you can't fence in
Free like a freeway, high on a highway
Packing up a getaway soul
Getting blacktop gone

Blacktop gone
Girl we're getting blacktop gone''''''''''''''''''
