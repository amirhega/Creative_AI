Pain
It's only a little pain, 
It'll be gone in a couple o' days, 
Or maybe a life or two, 
Heart 
It's only my poor heart, 
Just that little thing you tore apart, 
It ain't no headline news.

But a grown woman
Should've known better 
Than to treat me like some old lipstick 
You use up and throw away, 
Hey, hey, hey

Time, 
I wish I could turn back time, 
To when you were just a child, 
And teach you a thing or two about love,
It's okay if you wanna give up, 
But there's a way to leave someone, 
And You Don't Have To Be So Cruel.

'Cause a grown woman 
Should've known better 
Then to treat me like some old dishrag 
You use up and throw away 
Hey, hey, hey

You're supposed to treat your lover 
At least as good as your neighbor, 
So how could you, a grown woman 
Not know better.

I ain't no old lipstick 
You use up And throw away, 
When you're ready for another shade 
Hey, hey, hey, 
You should've known better, 
'Cause you're a grown woman.''''''''''''''''''''
