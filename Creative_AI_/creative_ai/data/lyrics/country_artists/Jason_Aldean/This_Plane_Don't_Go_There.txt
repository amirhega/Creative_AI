There's a moment I can see when I close my eyes from this window seat
It's you and me under a midnight sky
Leaning on your car in the parking lot, wish I could go back to that spot
The second right before we said goodbye

But this plane don't go there
This plane can't take me back in time
I could go anywhere
I can't go back to that night
If I could, I would, I swear
But this plane don't go there

I wish there were runway lights where they could land this thing tonight
You'd be right there waiting at the gate
I would stop you just before you're reaching for that drivers door
If yesterday could be today

But this plane don't go there
This plane can't take me back in time
I could go anywhere
I can't go back to that night
If I could, I would, I swear
But this plane don't go there

She's down there somewhere...
If I could go back there...

But this plane don't go there
This plane can't take me back in time
I could go anywhere
I can't go back to that night
If I could, I would, I swear
But this plane don't go there

No this plane don't go there...''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
