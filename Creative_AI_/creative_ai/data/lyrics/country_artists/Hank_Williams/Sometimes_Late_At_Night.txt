Sometimes late at night,
When our friends are fast asleep,
You say you'd like to take a stroll with me,
Tho we are wed to others, and it may not be right,
I have longed to hold you in my arms,
Sometimes late at night.

I've cried myself to sleep,
A thousand times or more,
But when I dream of you, my heart is light,
No matter what our friends may say,
And it may not be right,
I love you so, you know I'll go,
Sometimes late at night.
