Was it for crimes that I have done
He groaned upon on that tree 
Amazing pity grace unknown
And love beyond degree

At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light 
And the burden of my heart rolled away 
It was there by faith I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day 

Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut his glories in
When Christ the mighty Maker died
For man the creature of sin

But drops of grief can never repay
The depth of love I owe
Here Lord I give myself to you
That all that I can do''''''''''''''''
