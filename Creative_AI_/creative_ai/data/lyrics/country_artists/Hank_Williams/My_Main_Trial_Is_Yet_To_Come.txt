Sitting alone in my prison cell
Watching the setting sun
My trial on earth is over now

I'm sentenced to die at dawn
But after I die in the electric chair
The judge will give me the 'lectric chair
But that won't worry me
When I face the judge of eternity

Oh mother I'm leavin' you here alone
I've disgraced your name I know
This trial on earth was for my soul

I'm sentenced to die at dawn
But after I die in the electric chair
The judge will give me the 'lectric chair
But that won't worry me
When I face the judge of eternity''''''''''''''''''
