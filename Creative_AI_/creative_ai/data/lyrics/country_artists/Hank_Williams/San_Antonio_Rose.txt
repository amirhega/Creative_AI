Spoken intro:
Hi, neighbors, this is our new album
And we've chosen songs from the great Bob Wills
Who is a legend
As far as we in the business are concerned
And I know, people across the United States
You know, we finally call him the "Old Man"
Because to us, that's just what he is
You'll always know him by the lonesome fiddle
The white hat, the high-heeled boots
The cigar smoke, and some of these wonderful songs
We hope you like our version of 'em
As we pay tribute to one of the greatest of all time Bob Wills 

Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone

It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit path that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Moon in all your splendor knows only my heart
Call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love, my own

Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
And that moonlit pass BY the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit path that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Moon in all your splendor knows only my heart
Call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love, my own''''''''''''''''''
