Ever' time I see her passin' by
All I do is hang my head and cry
And I can't forget her tho I try
All I do is hang my head and cry

Oh, I know not how to ease my mind
Since she left a world of love be - hind
Ever' time I see her passin' by
All I do is hang my head and cry

Golden love, oh, golden love you're gone
But each broken dream still lingers on
And my weary heart keeps askin' why
All I do is hang my head and cry

Foolish pride, oh, pride, what have you done
You have made me lose my only one
Now each time I see her passin' by
All I do is hang my head and cry'' '' ''&''&''&''&''&''&''&''&
