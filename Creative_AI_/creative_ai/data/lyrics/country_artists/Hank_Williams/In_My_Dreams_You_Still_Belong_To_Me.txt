Now at last you've gone and left me
Like a piece of driftwood on the sea
You said that you no longer loved me
But in my dreams you still belong to me

In my dreams you're still my only darlin'
Just like you used to be
And tho I've lost you to another
In my dreams you still belong to me

At night when I am sad and lonely
It's then I really know you're gone
But I just go to sleep praying
That you'll be back before so long

No matter where you wander, darlin'
If it be across the deep blue sea
Everyday you'll know I'll miss you
And in my dreams you'll still belong to me

In my dreams you're still my only darlin'
Just like you used to be
And tho I lost you to another
In my dreams you still belong to me''''''''''''''''''
