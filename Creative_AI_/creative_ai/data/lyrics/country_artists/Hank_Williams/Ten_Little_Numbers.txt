Countin' numbers 1-2-3
Never was much fun to me
But I'm learnin' how to count in rhyme
Ten little numbers and a boogie time

Crazy words don't mean a thing
Simple tunes are hard to sing
Just as easy as A-B-C
A haul right off and count with me

One-sy, two-sy, zig-sy and
Haul up on a crack up on a wheelbarrow blackstone
Dollar weighs ten, dollar weighs ten

Rome-ian num'rals they're a pain,
I is one and X is ten
What's the use to bother your head
To count like Caesar when Caesar's dead

Higgama, jiggama, horney cuff,
How many fingers do I hold up
One you say, and ten I see
Now open your eyes and count with me

One-sy, two-sy, zig-sy and
Haul up on a crack up on a wheelbarrow blackstone
Dollar weighs ten, dollar weighs ten''''''''''''''''''
