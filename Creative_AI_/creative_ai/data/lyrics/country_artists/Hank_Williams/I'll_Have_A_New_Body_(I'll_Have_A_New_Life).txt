On that resurrection morning 
When all dead in Christ shall rise
I'll have a new body
Praise the Lord, I'll have a new life

Won't it be so bright and fair
When we meet our love ones there
I'll have a new body 
Praise the Lord, I'll have a new life

I'll have a new home of glory eternal 
Where the redeemed of God shall stand
There'll be no more sorrow
There'll be no more strife

Raised in the likeness of my Savior
Ready to live in Paradise
I'll have a new body
Praise the Lord, I'll have a new life 

When old Gabriel blows his trumpet
And we walk the streets of gold
I'll have a new body 
Praise the Lord, I'll have a new life

No more pain worry sorrow
In this wicked world of sin
I'll have a new body 
Praise the Lord, I'll have a new life

I'll have a new home of glory eternal 
Where the redeemed of God shall stand
There'll be no more sorrow
There'll be no more strife

Raised in the likeness of my Savior
Ready to live in Paradise
I'll have a new body
Praise the Lord, I'll have a new life 

Oh dear brother are you living 
For that day when Christ shall come
I'll have a new body 
Praise the Lord, I'll have a new life 

Graves all bursting Saints a shouting 
Heavenly beauty all around 
I'll have a new body 
Praise the Lord, I'll have a new life 

I'll have a new home of glory eternal 
Where the redeemed of God shall stand
There'll be no more sorrow
There'll be no more strife

Raised in the likeness of my Savior
Ready to live in Paradise
I'll have a new body
Praise the Lord, I'll have a new life''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
