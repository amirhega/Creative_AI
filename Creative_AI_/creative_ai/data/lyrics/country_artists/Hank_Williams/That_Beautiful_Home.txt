There's a beautiful home, far over the sea,
Their mansions of bliss, for you and for me,
Oh that beautiful home, so wonder fly fair,
That the savior for me, has gone to prepare.

(There's a beautiful home) far over the sea,
(There's a beautiful home) for you and for me,
(And it's glittering pow'r) the sun out shines,
(And that beautiful home) someday shall be mine.

In that beautiful home, a crown I shall wear,
When the glorified throne, that glory to share,
But the joys of that home, can never be known,
Till the savior we see, upon his white throne.''''''''''''''''
