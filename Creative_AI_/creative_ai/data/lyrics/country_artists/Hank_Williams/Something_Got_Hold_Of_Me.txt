Send me the pillow that you dream on
Don't you know that I still care for you?
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling, I can dream on it too

Each night while I'm sleeping, oh so lonely
I share your love in dreams that once were true
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling, I can dream on it too

I've waited so long for you to write me
But just a memory's all that's left of you
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling, I can dream on it too
So darling, I can dream on it too''''''''''''''''
