Honey do you love me, huh, honey do you love me, huh,
Do you want to marry, got no time to tarry,
Honey do you love me, huh, quit your hesitatin',
I'm tired of waitin', honey do you love me, huh.

Honey won't you hold me tight, honey won't you hold me tight,
That ole moon above, was just made for love,
Honey won't you hold me tight, start your turtle dovein'
I need a little lovin', honey won't you hold me tight.

Honey do you love me, huh, honey do you love me, huh,
Do you want to marry, got no time to tarry,
Honey do you love me, huh, quit your hesitatin',
I'm tired of waitin', honey do you love me, huh.''''''''''''''''''
