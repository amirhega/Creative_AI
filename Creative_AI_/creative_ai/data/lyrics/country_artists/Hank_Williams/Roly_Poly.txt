Hey Roly Poly eatin' corn and taters hungry every minute of the day
Roly Poly knowin' all the biscuits long as he can chew it it's okay
He can eat an apple pie and never even bat an eye
He likes everything from a soup to hay
Roly Poly daddy's little fatty and he's gonna be a man someday
Roly Poly scrambled eggs for breakfast bread and jelly twenty times a day
Roly Poly eats a hard day dinner it takes lots of strength to run and play
Bowls up weeds and does the chores run both ways to Holday's stores
He wears up that apetite that way
Roly Poly daddy's little fatty but he's gonna be a man someday''''''''''''''''''
