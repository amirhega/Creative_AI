I went to the old home --- where I once used to roam
And all of my friends --- had ev'ryone gone
How sad and how drear --- no voice did I hear
There was no one --- to welcome me home.

No one --- to welcome me home;
Oh! no, no one --- to welcome me home
How sad and how drear --- no voice could I hear
There was no one --- to welcome me home.

I went to the old school --- where I once loved to play
And all of my playmates had every one gone
So lonesome and drear --- no voice did I hear
There was no one --- to welcome me home.

No one - to welcome me home
There was one --- to welcome me home
But, when I behold --- that mansion of gold
There'll be someone --- to welcome me home.''''''''''''''''
