Raccoon up the 'simmon tree,
'Possum up the gum.
Never did see a pretty girl,
But what I love her some.

Bile them cabbage down, boys,
Bake those hot cakes brown, boys.
The only song that I can sing,
Is bile them cabbage down.

Raccoon up the 'simmon tree,
'Possum on the ground.
'Possum said to the 'coon
Shake some 'simmons down.''''''''''''''''''''''''
