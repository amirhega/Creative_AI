I was strollin' one day, in a lonely graveyard,
When a voice from the tomb, seemed to say,
I once lived as you live, walked and talked as you talk,
But from earth I was soon called away.

Oh, those tombs, ("oh those tombs"),
Lonely tombs, ("lonely tombs "),
Seemed to say in a low gentle tone,
Oh how (e) sweet, ("oh how sweet"),
Is the rest, ("is the rest"),
In our beautiful, heavenly home.

Every voice from the tomb, seemed to whisper and say,
Livin' man you must soon follow me,
And I thought as I gazed, on that cold marble slab,
What a sad lonesome place that must be.

Oh, those tombs, ("oh those tombs"),
Lonely tombs, ("lonely tombs "),
Seemed to say in a low gentle tone,
Oh how (e) sweet, ("oh how sweet"),
Is the rest, ("is the rest"),
In our beautiful, heavenly home.

I then came to the place, where my mother did lay,
And her voice, soft and low, from the tomb,
It said, son I'm at rest, with the savior above,
I am safe in my heavenly home.

Oh, those tombs, ("oh those tombs"),
Lonely tombs, ("lonely tombs "),
Seemed to say in a low gentle tone,
Oh how (e) sweet, ("oh how sweet"),
Is the rest, ("is the rest"),
In our beautiful, heavenly home.''''''''''''''''''
