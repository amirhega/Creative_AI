I'll take you to the picture show and babe I'll hold your hand,
I'll sit up in your parlor, let you cool me with your fan,
I'll listen to your troubles and pet you when you cry, but get
That marryin' out of your head, I'll be a bachelor till I die.

I don't mind honky tonkin' 'round if that will bring you fun,
But somehow I can't undersdtand how one and one make one,
I like to cuddle near you and listen to you lie,
But get that marryin' out of your head, I'll be a bachelor till I die.

Now if you want a helpmate you're wastin' lots of time,
'Cause I'm afraid of church bells, how they scare me when they chime,
I've seen those married people just up and say goodbye,
So get that marryin' out of your head, I'll be a bachelor till I die.

This freedom's mighty precious in this land of liberty,
I've seen what matrimony done to better men than me,

But keep that marryin' out of your head, I'll be a bachelor till I die.''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
