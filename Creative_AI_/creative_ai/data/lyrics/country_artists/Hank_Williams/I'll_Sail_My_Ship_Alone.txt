We've been sweethearts for so long but now you say we're through
The love we shared is a just a memory
I have built a ship of dreams and planned them all for you
But I guess what it is to be mine, you will be

I'll sail my ship alone with all the dreams I own
Driftin' out across the ocean blue
I'll sail my ship alone with all the dreams I own
And when it starts a-sinkin' I'll blame you

Then I gave a message to the wind to take back on to you
Hoping you would hear my S.O.S
Maybe you would come back home but darling if you knew
How much my aching heart is in distress

And I'll sail my ship alone with all the dreams I own
Driftin' out across the ocean blue
I'll sail my ship alone with all the dreams I own
And when it starts a-sinkin' I'll blame you'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
