Lost on the river
Dark is the night
Just like the blind
Praying for sight
Drifting alone 
Heart filled with strife
I'm lost on the river
The river of life

Once dear I thought
I knew the way
But that was before
Old sad yesterday
Words that you told me
Cut like a knife
I'm lost on the river
The river of life

Out on this river
Where sorrow creeps
Thiinking of you
And how my heart weeps
Tomorrow you'll be
Another man's wife
And I'm lost on the river
The river of life''''''''''''''''''
