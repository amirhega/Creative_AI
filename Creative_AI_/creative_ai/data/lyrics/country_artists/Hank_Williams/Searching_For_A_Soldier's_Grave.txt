Somewhere here among these many thousands
Of Americans who all died true and brave
That's where I know I'll find him resting
So I'm here, I'm searching for his grave

You ask me, stranger, why I made this journey
Why cross three thousand miles of rolling waves
Like many others, my darling was killed in action
That's why I'm here, I'm searching for his grave

Somewhere here among these many thousands
Of Americans who all died true and brave
That's where I know I'll find him resting
So I'm here, I'm searching for his grave

When I come to the spot where he's sleeping
I know it will 'cause more heartaches inside
But I'll long to be by his side once more and tell him
Tell him that I love him and will until I die

Somewhere here among these many thousands
Of Americans who all died true and brave
That's where I know I'll find him resting
So I'm here, I'm searching for his grave'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
