I'm free at last from love and all its' worries
I'm free because you wanted it that way
Now you can go but there's no need to hurry
'Cause ne'er again will I ask you to stay.

So run along, I know that you don't want me
So many times you've proved that in the past
After you're gone, when mem'ries come to haunt me
I'll hide my tears and say I'm free at last.

I'm free at last don't ask me why I'm cryin'
Strange as it seems, somehow I love you yet
Don't say you care, you know that you'll be lying
Don't hurt me more, show my heart some respect.

So run along, I know that you don't want me
So many times you've proved that in the past
After you're gone, when mem'ries come to haunt me
I'll hide my tears and say I'm free at last.'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
