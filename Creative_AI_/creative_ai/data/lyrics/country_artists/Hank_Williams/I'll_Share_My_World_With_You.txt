Written by Ben Wilson

I'll share my world with you
Ev'rything that I own
My earthly possessions
They're no good if I'm alone
Let me give you the sunshine
While it's fresh with morning dew
Can't you see that I'm waiting
To share my world with you

I'll share my world with you
If you'll be mine alone
I'll give you a new heart
You're the only love it's known
Let me give you my two arms
They'll be reaching when you do
Can't you see they are waiting
To share my world with you

I'll share my world with you
Ev'rything that I see
Divide all the memories
One for you, and one for me
Oh let me give you my two lips
They'll be smile when you do
Can't you see they are waiting
To share my world with you

Can't you see they are waiting
To share my world with you''''''''''''''''''''''''
