If you will listen
A song I will sing
About my daddy
Who ran a log train

Way down in the southland
In old Alabam'
We lived in a place
That they called Chapman Town

And late in the evening
When the sun was low
Way off in the distance
You could hear the train blow

The folks would come runnin'
And mama would sing
Get the supper on the table
Here comes the log train

Every morning
At the break day
He'd grab his lunch bucket
And be on his way

Winter or summer
Sunshine or rain
Every morning he'd run
That old log train

A sweatin' and swearin'
All day long
Shoutin' get up the oxens
Keep movin' along

Load'er up boys
'Cause it looks like rain
I've got to get rollin'
This old log train

This story happened
A long time ago
The log train is silent
God called dad to go

But when I get to heaven
To always remain
I'll listen for whistle
On the old log train''''''''''''''''''
