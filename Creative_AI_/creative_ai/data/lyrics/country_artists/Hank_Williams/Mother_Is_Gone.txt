In a little pine grove by the old home
There's someone who's restin' alone
And there on the the tomb, these words I read
The words were Mother is gone.

Mother is gone, to her home
Way up in heaven above
And my heart's so sad, for the words I read there
The words said Mother is gone.

As I stood alone, with mem'ries of home
The place I left long, long ago
I returned home, but I waited too long
For the words said, Mother is gone.

My friends did say, before she went away
She called my name o'er and o'er
So trustin' in God's love, I'll meet her above
Over there on that other shore.

Mother is gone, to her home
Way up in heaven above
And my heart's so sad, for the words I read there
The words said Mother is gone.''''''''''''''''''
