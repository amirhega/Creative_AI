Just when I needed you, you left and went away,
You made my life so blue both night and day,
You left me here behind, with a troubled worried mind,
So broken hearted too, just when I needed you.

I cried, I cried, I prayed, lord, I tried, to forget you,
And never call your name, what a shame, what a shame,
You're the one who was to blame,
You're the one who was untrue, just when I needed you.

You said, it's best we part, and never love again,
And 'tho it broke my heart, I won't complain,
You know I love you still, and dear I always will,
Altho you proved untrue, just when I needed you.

I cried, I cried, I prayed, lord, I tried, to forget you,
And never call your name, what a shame, what a shame,
You're the one who was to blame,
You're the one who was untrue, just when I needed you.''''''''''''''''''
