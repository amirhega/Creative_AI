Standin' by a lonesome graveside
Everything I love is gone
Weeping as they lay my darlin'
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

In this world I'm left to wander
With no one to call my own
While my precious darlin's sleepin'
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

Out there in that lonesome graveyard
She is sleepin' all alone
And they buryied my heart with her
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

Skies above were dark and stormin'
For the sunshine, all is gone
And the one I love is sleepin'
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

My heart is dead and yet I'm living
Wondering through this world alone
I wish that I was with my darlin'
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
