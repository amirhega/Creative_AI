I'll be your baby
And I don't mean maybe
If you'll be a baby to me
I'll be your darlin'
And there'll be no quarralin'
If you'll be a baby to me
I can plow and milk the cow
I'll even do the churnin'
You just look through your cookbook
And keep the homefires burnin'
Baby, I'll be your baby
If you'll be a baby to me'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
