I'm a'headin' back to dixie,
That's the place I long to be,
Where the cotton grows and the suwanee flows,
That's home sweet home to me,
Where they meet you and they greet you,
With the sweetest how you are,
Well shut my mouth, I'm a'headin' south,
On the dixie cannon- ball

On the dixie cannonball, on the dixie cannonball,
Just listen to the whistle, it'll thrill you one and all,
And I know there's some one waitin', with the sweetest how you are,
Well shut my mouth, I'm a'headin' south, on the dixie cannonball

When I cross them smokey mountains. I'll be countin' every mile,
When the whistle blows, I'll be on my toes,
And I'll shuffle down the aisle,
And I know I'll not be lonesome,
When I see them treetops tall,
On the dixie cannonball

On the dixie cannonball, on the dixie cannonball,
Just listen to the whistle, it'll thrill you one and all,
And I know there's some one waitin', with the sweetest how you are,
Well shut my mouth, I'm a'headin' south, on the dixie cannonball

Yes, I'm goin' back to dixie, that's the place I long to be,
Where the cotton grows and the suwanee flows,
That's home sweet home to me,
Where they meet you and they greet you,
With the sweetest how you are,
Well shut my mouth, I'm a'headin' south,
On the dixie cannon- ball

On the dixie cannonball, on the dixie cannonball,
Just listen to the whistle, it'll thrill you one and all,
And I know there's some one waitin', with the sweetest how you are,
Well shut my mouth, I'm a'headin' south, on the dixie cannonball''''''''''''''''''
