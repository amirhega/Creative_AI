I was all alone and drifting on a lonely sea of sin
Nothing but darkness, no sunshine within
I lifted my eyes, to the Lord in the sky
And Jesus remembered me.

Jesus remembered me
And so He set me free
Once I was blinded, but now I can see
Glory to God, He remembered me.

Now the sun is shining, I'm happy and free
No more sorrow, no troubles to see
I'm going home to glory, my Saviour to see
Glory to God, He rememberd me.

Jesus remembered me
And so He set me free
Once I was blinded, but now I can see
Glory to God, He remembered me.

When He talked to His disciples at the Sea of Galilee
He said He'd remember a mortal like me
I asked for His blessing down on my knees
And glory to God, He remembered me.''''''''''''''''''
