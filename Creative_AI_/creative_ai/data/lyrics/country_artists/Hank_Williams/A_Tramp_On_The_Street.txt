Only a tramp was Lazarus sad fate
He who lay down at the rich man's gate
He begged for the crumbs from the rich man to eat
He was only a tramp found dead on the street

He was some mother's darlin', he was some mother's son
Once he was fair and once he was young
And some mother rocked him, her darlin' to sleep
But they left him to die like a tramp on the street

Jesus, he died on Calvary's tree
He shed his life's blood for you and for me
They pierced his side and then his feet
And they left him to die like a tramp on the street

He was Mary's own darlin', he was God's chosen son
Once he was fair and once he was young
Mary, she rocked him, her darlin' to sleep
Then the gods would deny you on the great Judgement Day''''''''''''''''''''
