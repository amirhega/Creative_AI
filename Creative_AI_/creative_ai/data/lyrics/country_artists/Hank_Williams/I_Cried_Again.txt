Teardrops fell the night you said
I love you dear but you are wed
I watched you as you held his hand
Then I turned away and cried again

I cried again when I reached home
There sat your picture all alone
I thought of things that might have been
I bowed my head and cried again

I took your letters from the shelf
Then read aloud just to myself
But just before I reached the end
I bowed my head and cried again

I cried again when I reached home
There sat your picture all alone
I thought of things that might have been
I bowed my head and cried again

And here's the reason why I say
Dear, I must throw your things away
For they would only bring me pain
And I'd bow my head and cry again

I cried again when I reached home
There sat your picture all alone
I thought of things that might have been
I bowed my head and cried again''''''''''''''''''
