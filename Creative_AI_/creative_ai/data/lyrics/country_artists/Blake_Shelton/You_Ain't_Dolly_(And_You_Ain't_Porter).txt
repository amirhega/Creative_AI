Shelton: Who couldn't help but see you in that rhinestone suit?
Monroe: That's 'cause I'm the reigning queen of karaoke night
Shelton: Well, if I get drunk enough to sing, hell, I just might
Monroe: Hey now, don't you worry, cowboy, 'cause I'll get you through

Shelton: 'Cause you ain't Dolly
Monroe: And you ain't Porter
