Adam Wakefield:
Well, Hank, let's talk about your daddy
Tell me how your mama loved that man
Blake Shelton:
Well, just break out a bottle, hoss
I'll tell ya' 'bout the drifting cowboy band
And the man
Adam Wakefield:
Well, we won't talk about the habits
Both:
Just the music and the man

Adam Wakefield:
Well now, Hank, you just gotta tell me
Did your daddy really write all them songs
Spoken:
Well, did he?
Blake Shelton:
Well, that don't deserve no answer, hoss
Let's light up and just move along
Adam Wakefield:
Do you think he wrote 'em about your mama
About the man who done her wrong?

Both:
Yeah, back then they called him crazy
Nowadays they call him a saint
Yeah, now the ones that called him crazy
Blake Shelton:
Are still ridin' on his name

Adam Wakefield:
Well, if he was here right now, Bocephus
Would he think that we were right?
Spoken:
Do you think he might?
Blake Shelton:
Don't you know he would, watashi
Be right here by our side
Adam Wakefield:
If we left for a show in Provo
Be the first one on the bus and ready to ride

Both:
Yeah, back then they called him crazy
Nowadays they call him a saint
Blake Shelton:
Most folks don't know that
Both:
They fired him from the Opry
Blake Shelton:
And that 'caused his greatest pain

Blake Shelton:
I wanna tell you about lovesick
How Miss Audrey loved that man
Adam Wakefield:
You know, I've always loved to listen
To the stories 'bout that drifting cowboy band
And the man
Blake Shelton:
Yeah, when you get right down to it
Both:
He's still the most wanted outlaw in the land
Adam Wakefield:
Know when you get right down to it
Still the most wanted outlaw in the land''''''''''''''''
