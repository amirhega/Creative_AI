Well, I made a mess of my life
Each time I went left I should've gone right
And love's no exception to this rule
'Cause I turned around an' I lost you

Now I'm feeling lonesome and blue
Just the way I expect to
But there's somethings that I could use
To help me deal with this abuse
If French fries were fat free
And you still loved me

If French fries were fat free
And you still loved me
What a wonderful world this would be
If the whiskey really helped me
Forget your memory
I'd wear a smile endlessly
If French fries were fat free
And you still loved me

You know the more I think about you
The more sense it makes
Cause grease and love 
Both cause heartache
So I raise my glass and toast
These things I want the most
Though I probably never see
I can't help but believing

That if French fries were fat free
And you still loved me
What a wonderful world this would be
If the whiskey really helped me
Forget your memory
I'd wear a smile endlessly
If French fries were fat free
And you still loved me
Oh, if French fries were fat free
And you still loved me''''''''''''''''''
