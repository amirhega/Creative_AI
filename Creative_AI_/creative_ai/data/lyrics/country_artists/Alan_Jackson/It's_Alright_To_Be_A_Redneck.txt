A-bom bom, a-bom bom, a-bom bom, bom bom bom
A-bom bom, a-bom bom, a-bom bom, bom bom bom
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to ride around in a dirty ol' truck
Catch a bunch o' fish and shoot a bunch o' duck
It's alright to be a redneck
Chase around girls on Friday night
You wanna make 'em feel alright

It's alright (it's alright), it's alright (it's alright)
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to work hard in the sun all day
Drink a couple o' beers after balin' hay
It's good to be a redneck
Drive by Ernie's for some barbecue
Showin' off your brand new boots

It's alright (it's alright), it's alright (it's alright)
It's alright to be a redneck

The kids are gonna cry 
And the chicken's gonna fry
Oh, you know it
Your car won't run 
So your cousin's comin' by to tow it

Ba-bom-bom, ba-bom-bom, a-bom-bom-bom-bom
Ba-bom-bom, ba-bom-bom, a-bom-bom-bom-bom
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to have a girl
Named Thelma Lou
That don't mind a little kiss 
When you got a little chew
Party on the road
By the light of the moon
Dancin' to a country tune

It's alright (it's alright), it's alright (it's alright)
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright (it's alright), it's alright (it's alright)
It's alright to be a redneck

Yeah, it's alright (it's alright), it's just right (it's alright)
It's alright to be a redneck
Yeah, it's alright (it's alright), it's alright (it's alright)
It's alright to be a redneck now
Ba-bom-bom (it's alright), ba-bom-bom (it's alright), a-bom-bom-bom-bom
Ba-bom-bom, ba-bom-bom, a-bom-bom-bom-bom
Ba-bom-bom (it's alright), ba-bom-bom (it's alright), a-bom-bom-bom-bom
I'm gone'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
