I woke up with her in my arms this morning
God knows, I love her over all
As she whispered she loved me, your memory appeared
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all

You were here, we loved, but now you're gone
Why can't you let bygones all be bygones, yes, and stay gone
You always find the wrong times to come around to call
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all

Tonight I lay here touching her sweet body
And the good familiar feeling I recall
I closed my eyes to kiss her your memory appeared
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all

You were here, we loved, but now you're gone
Why can't you let bygones all be bygones, yes, and stay gone
You always find the wrong times to come around to call
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all''''''''''''''''''''''''
