That sun is hot and that old clock is moving slow
And so am I
The workday passes like molasses in wintertime
But it's July
I'm getting paid by the hour and older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd love to call him something, but I think I'll just call it a day
Pour me something tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere
Well this lunchbreak is gonna take all afternoon
And half the night
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be hell to pay
Hey, but that's alright
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
My Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone is for me you can tell 'em I just sailed away
Pour me something tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere
I could pay off my tab, pour myself in a cab
And be back to work before two
But at a moment like this I can't help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffett do
He'd say pour me something tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
