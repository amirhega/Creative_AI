She loves the music, tells the tales of her heart
And she listens closely to the beats and the parts
She likes the songs that make her cry
And ones that pick her up and make her high

She likes the hip-hop, she loves to rock it
She's got country on her iPod in her pocket
She loves the guitar, she likes the fiddle
She even likes the ones where they just talk in rhyme and riddles

And she sings along as she's drivin' home, knowin' all along
Her life's a song

And she likes the songs that take her back and make her want
Sometimes she just wants to dance and move on
She taps her feet or sheds a tear
Plays air guitar or raises a beer

She likes the hip-hop, she loves to rock it
She's got country on her iPod in her pocket
She loves the guitar, she likes the fiddle
She even likes the ones where they just talk in rhyme and riddles

And she sings along as she's drivin' home, knowin' all along
Her life's a song

At times it seems they know just how she feels
A broken heart or a love song that kills

She likes the hip-hop, she loves to rock it
She's got country on her iPod in her pocket
She loves the guitar, she likes the fiddle
She even likes the ones where they just talk in rhyme and riddles

And she sings along as she's driving home, knowin' all along
Her life's a song

She likes the hip-hop, she loves to rock it
She's got country on her iPod in her pocket
She loves the guitar, she likes the fiddle
She even likes the ones where they just talk in rhyme and riddles

And she sings 'em all as she's driving home, knowin' all along
Her life's a song

Yeah, her life's a song

Yeah, her life's a song

She sings along
'Cause her life's a song''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
