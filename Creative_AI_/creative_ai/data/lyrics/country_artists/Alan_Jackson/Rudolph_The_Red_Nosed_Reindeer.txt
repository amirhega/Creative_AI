You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixon
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw him,
You would even say it glows.

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games. 

Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say:
Hey, Rudolph with your nose so bright, 
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight? 

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee:
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
You'll go down in history!

You'll go down in history!...''''''''''''''
