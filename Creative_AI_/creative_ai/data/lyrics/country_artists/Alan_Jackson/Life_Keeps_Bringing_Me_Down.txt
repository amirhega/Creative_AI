I'm the poorest old boy that you will ever see
Life keeps bringin' me down
Whenever I'm trying livin' above my means
Life keeps bringin' me down

Yeah, life keeps bringin' me down
Blues keep comin' around
Hard livin's gonna be the death of me
Life keeps bringin' me down

When the clouds roll in and the sun won't shine
Life keeps bringin' me down
Now my dollar bills ain't worth a dime
Life keeps bringin' me down

Yeah, life keeps bringin' me down
Big tears drops hittin' the ground
Well, it won't stop rainin' on this heart of mine
Life keeps bringin' me down

Yeah, I hate to wake up when the mornin' comes
Life keeps bringin' me down
But I drank a pot of coffee and I'm on the run
Life keeps bringin' me down

Yeah, life keeps bringin' me down
The world keeps spinnin' around
Yeah that old rat race it ain't no fun
Life keeps bringin' me down

I've got a mountain of debt to crawl out from under
Life keeps bringin' me down
But one of these days I'm gonna hit the numbers
Life keeps bringin' me down

Yeah, life keeps bringin' me down
I'm all ground down to the bottom of the ground
Yeah, it's been a bummer the whole damn summer
Life keeps bringin' me down

Yeah, life keeps bringing me down''''''''''''''''''''''''
