I stare out the window at this long interstate
Backed up in traffic, I just sit here and wait
And dream of wide-open spaces, no fences or gates
But this is the 90's, guess I was just born too late

The smog from the city, it sure burns my eyes
Sometimes I wonder just how we'll survive
We keep runnin' faster but are we losing the race
Well I guess I'm old fashioned, just born too late

Just born too late
For these modern days
I should have lived
Before microwaves
I'm like an endangered species
Just captured by fate
But I have no choice
I was just born too late

This built in computer tells me how far I've been
Another advancement of this age we live in
But it can't change a scenery or help me escape
The constant reminder that I was just born too late

I was just born too late
For these modern days
I should have lived
Before microwaves
I'm like an endangered species
Just captured by fate
But I have no choice
I was just born too late

No I have no choice, I was just born too late''''''''''''''''''
