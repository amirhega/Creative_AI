If the wife and I was fussin', brother that's our right
Me and that ole woman bought a license to fight
Why don't you mind your own business (Mind your own business)
Yeah, mind your own business (Mind your own business)
If you mind your own business, you won't be mindin' mine.

Well, the woman on the party line's a nosey thing
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring
Why don't you mind your own business (Mind your own business)
Yeah, mind your own business (Mind your own business)
If you mind your own business, you won't be mindin' mine.

Well, I got a little girl that wears her hair up high
The boys all hollar when she walks by
Why don't you mind your own business (Mind your own business)
Yeah, mind your own business (Mind your own business)
Just mind your own business, you won't be mindin' mine.

I may tell a lot of stories that may not be true
But I can get to Heaven just as easy as you
Why don't you mind your own business (Mind your own business)
Yeah, will you mind your own business (Mind your own business)
Mind your business, and you won't be mindin' mine.

Now, If I want to honky tonk till around two or three
Darlin' that's my headache, don't you worry 'bout me.
Why don't you mind your own business (Mind your own business)
Go on and mind your own business (Mind your own business)
If you're mindin' your business, you won't be mindin' mine.

Mindin' other people's business seems to be high-toned
Well, I got all that I can do just to mind my own
Mind your own business (Mind your own business)
Yeah, mind your own business (Mind your own business)
If you mind your businessm you won't be mindin' mine.

Dear Lord, If you mind your business, you'll be busy all the time...''''''''''''''''
