Let me just say for the sake of conversation
If there's such a thing as reincarnation
But don't you go cryin' for me when I'm gone
'Cause I'm gonna come back as a country song

I'll be playin' all night in every honky tonk bar
In the middle of a fiddle and a steel guitar
I'm hopin' when the good Lord calls me home
I'm gonna come back as a country song

I don't have to say it'd be Heaven to me
Watchin' neon lights for eternity
So go ahead and put it on my headstone
Yeah, I'm gonna come back as a country song

I'll be playin' all night in every honky tonk bar
In the middle of a fiddle and a steel guitar
I'm hopin' when the good Lord calls me home
I'm gonna come back as a country song

So here I am on a stool tonight
Yeah, I'm practicin' up for the after life
'Cause when I'm nothin' but a pile of bones
I'm gonna come back as a country song

I'll be playin' all night in every honky tonk bar
In the middle of a fiddle and a steel guitar
I'm hopin' when the good Lord calls me home
I'm gonna come back as a country song

I'm hopin' when the good Lord calls me home
I'm gonna come back as a country song''''''''''''''''''''''''''
