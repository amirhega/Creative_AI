I've watched you hide the pain too many times
Much too often you don't say what's in your heart
But you don't have to say it's over, I can see it in your eyes
'Cause if tears could talk, you just said goodbye

Without a word, you took our picture from the wall
And your dresses from the closet down the hall
When I tried to talk it over, you just turned away and cried
But if tears could talk, you just said goodbye

And if mirrors spoke they'd tell me I'm a fool
For never loving you the way I wanted to
And if silence says it all I guess it means our love has died
And if tears could talk, you just said goodbye

And if mirrors spoke they'd tell me I'm a fool
For never loving you the way I wanted to
And if silence says it all I guess it means our love has died
And if tears could talk, you just said goodbye
Oh if tears could talk, you just said goodbye''''''''''''''''
