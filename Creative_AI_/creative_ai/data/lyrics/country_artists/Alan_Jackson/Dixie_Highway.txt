Alan Jackson & Zac Brown *Both*:
I was born, on the Dixie Highway
Red clay and Georgia pines
I was raised, on the Dixie Highway
No sweeter place youll ever find

A wood frame house, and gravel driveway
Willow trees, an old front porch
Just outside, the city limits
Out on the highway 34

Yeah, I was born, on the Dixie Highway
Red clay and Georgia pines
I was raised, on the Dixie Highway
No sweeter place youll ever find

(You will never find)

And havin' tobacco, growin' on the roadside
Rolled it up, and we smoked it down
It dont do much, but it makes you feel big
When youre ten years old, in a tiny town

Yeah, I was born, on the Dixie Highway
Red clay and Georgia pines
Yeah, I was raised, on the Dixie Highway
No sweeter place youll ever find

Have a chicken pen, right in the backyard
Clothes line runnin', east to west
Butter bean, and Tomato garden
Six days, and a Sunday rest

I was born (I was born), on the Dixie Highway (Dixie Highway)
*Red clay and Georgia pines*
I was raised (I was raised), on the Dixie Highway (Dixie Highway)
*No sweeter place youll ever find*

Summertime, hot and hazy
Bare feet, and a water hose
Melon rind, on a country table
Lightnin' bugs, when the sun goes down

I was born (Yeah, I was born), on the Dixie Highway (Way down in Dixie)
*Red clay and Georgia pines*
Yeah, I was raised (Yeah, I was raised), on the Dixie Highway (Down the Dixie Highway)
*No sweeter place youll ever find*

And the holy ghost, on a Sunday morning
Gospel songs, and a Bible read
Sunday lunch, at momma's table
Thank the Lord, and break the bread

I was born (I was born), on the Dixie Highway (Dixie Highway)
*Red clay and Georgia pines*
I was raised (I was raised), on the Dixie Highway (Dixie Highway)
*No sweeter place youll ever find*

Screened in porch, right at the backdoor
Washin' machine, and an old wood stove
Mommas singin', in the kitchen
Rollin' homemade biscuit dough

I was born (I was born), on the Dixie Highway (Dixie Highway)
*Red clay and Georgia pines*
And I was raised (I was raised), on the Dixie Highway (Dixie Highway)
*No sweeter place youll ever find*

When Im old, and Heavens callin'
And they come to carry me away
Just lay me down, down in south land
*Bury me in the Georgia clay*

*Yeah, I was born, on the Dixie Highway
Red clay and Georgia pines*
I was raised (Yeah, I was raised), on the Dixie Highway
*No sweeter place youll ever find*
*No sweeter place youll ever find*
*No sweeter place*, youll ever, find''''''''''''''''''''''''
