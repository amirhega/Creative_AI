You're askin' me to tell you, how to deal with that old flame
When you see her out there, and you still feel the same
How she ripped out your whole heart, and took it with her when she left
You're face to face now lookin' at her, shes holdin' on to somebody else

Tell her you don't love her, and tell her you don't care
And tell her you don't need her, and you don't miss her there
And give her that cold shoulder, and say you never cry
Just look her in the eye and lie

You may not get over, some loves in your life
But as you get older, you'll know wrong more than right
But you might get lucky, and those feelin's fade away
The chances are they'll come back around, but you'll be ready now with just what to say

Just tell her you don't love her, and tell her you don't care
And tell her you don't need her, and you don't miss her there
And give her that cold shoulder, and say you never cry
Just look her in the eye and lie

And tell her you don't love her, and tell her you don't care
And tell her you don't need her, and you don't miss her there
And give her that cold shoulder, and say you never cry
Yeah, just look her in the eye and lie''''''''''''''''''''''''
