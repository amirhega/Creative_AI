If I could make a livin' out of lovin' you,
I'd be a millionaire in a week or two,
I'd be doin' what I love, and lovin' what I do,
If I could make a livin' out of lovin' you.

Early in the morning, when the sun comes up,
I'm punchin' that clock on the wall,
Breakin' my back just to make you bucks,
Wishin' I was in your arms.

If I could make a livin' out of lovin' you,
I'd be a millionaire in a week or two,
I'd be doin' what I love, and lovin' what I do,
If I could make a livin' out of lovin' you.

If I could make a livin' out of lovin' you,
I'd be a millionaire in a week or two,
I'd be doin' what I love, and lovin' what I do,
If I could make a livin' out of lovin' you...''''''''''''''
