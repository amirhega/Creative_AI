The girl I loved, she sure was pretty
But always runnin' round
She finally ran off with a boy from the city
And I ain't got trouble now

I ain't got trouble now
No I ain't got trouble now
I had it before, and I'll have some more
But I ain't got trouble now

Spent ten years breakin' my back
For the meanest man in town
Today I walked out and I ain't goin' back
And I ain't got trouble now

I ain't got trouble now
No I ain't got trouble now
I had it before, and I'll have some more
But I ain't got trouble now

Had an ol' rust bucket and four ball tires
Always breaking down
Been walkin' every day since it caught on fire
And I ain't got trouble now

I ain't got trouble now
No I ain't got trouble now
I had it before, and I'll have some more
But I ain't got trouble now

Now I got no ride, I got no money
And there ain't no girls in this town
But the whiskey goes down, smooth as honey
And I ain't got trouble now

I ain't got trouble now
No I ain't got trouble now
I had it before, and I'll have some more
But I ain't got trouble now'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
