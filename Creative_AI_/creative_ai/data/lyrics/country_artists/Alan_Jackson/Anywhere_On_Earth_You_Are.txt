I've been ridin' these blue highways
Another night has made me stop
My weary bones can go no farther
And here is where they'll drop

In my dreams your arms will find me 
They will hold me through the night
Then release me to my journey
As another day grows light

I've got so many miles to go 
And promises to keep
Right now all I want to do
Is be anywhere on earth you are

I have always been a gypsy 
And the road call me to roam
But each day brings me closer
To the place where we call home

I've got so many miles to go 
And promises to keep
Right now all I want to do
Is be anywhere on earth you are

In my dreams your arms will find me 
They will hold me through the night
Right now all I want to do 
Is be anywhere on earth you are''''''''''''''''''
