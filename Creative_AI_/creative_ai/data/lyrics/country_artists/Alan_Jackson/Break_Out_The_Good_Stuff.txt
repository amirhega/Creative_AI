I don't need Havanna cigars
Fancy C-cars or premium beer
I smoke whatever's cheap
Keep my ol' gas heater and drink what's here
Oh, the finer things in life don't thrill me much
When it comes to love, when it comes to love

I go home and break out the good stuff
All the good love is waiting for me
Anything less than her ain't nearly enough love
So I go home and break out the good stuff

I could keep another lover undercover, she'd never know
But everything I long for is benhind my own door
And I love her so
And when that loving feeling gets to me
There's just one place I wanna be

I go home and break out the good stuff
All the good love, waiting for me
Anything less than her ain't nearly enough love
So I go home and break out the good stuff
I go home and break out the good stuff
All the good love, waiting for me
Anything less than her ain't nearly enough love
So I go home and break out the good stuff...''''''''''''''''
