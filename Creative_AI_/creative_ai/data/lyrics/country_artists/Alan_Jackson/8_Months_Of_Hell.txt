I remember how you looked that day
And thought we would be together
Until we were both old and gray

But, after 7 years of happiness & 8 month's of hell
7 years of loving you
My perfect world fell

2 blessings came, a baby girl for you and for me a baby boy

But after 7 years of happiness & 8 months of hell
7years of loving you

My perfect world fell

Then your cheating game, with all of the mysterious names
Said you were working late,
But was out on a date,

So after 7 years of happiness & 8 months of hell
7 years of loving you
You threw it to hell''''''''''''''''''''''''
