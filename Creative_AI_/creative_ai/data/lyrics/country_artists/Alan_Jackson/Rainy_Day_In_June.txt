I need some sunshine on my face
To help me dry my eyes
I need a blue sky over here
So I can clear my mind

Maybe a soft breeze on my back
To make me feel at ease
Anything more than what I've got
On this rainy day in June.

It's a rainy day in June
The sky is grey and I am blue
Tryin' to make it without you
On this rainy day in June

Yesterday morning I woke up
On the wrong side of the bed
And on the right side laid a note
I knew what it said

Then the rain came, hasn't stopped
And I don't know if it will
But I'll keep waiting with a hopeful heart
On this rainy day in June

It's a rainy day in June
The sky is grey and I am blue
Tryin' to make it without you
On this rainy day in June

The thunder rolls, the lightning flashes
Every thought begins with you
I see your face in every cloud that passes
On this rainy day in June

It's a rainy day in June
The sky is grey and I am blue
Tryin' to make it without you
On this rainy day in June''''''''''''''''''
