You boys are ready in the woods?
That's right

We cut them all, yeah
Yeah, we're talking shotguns
We cut them all, yeah
Country boys don't never run

We cut them all, yeah
If it flies, it flies
We cut them all, yeah
Country side, this is how we're living

They call me Colt Ford, a red neck boy from down in the South
I pray for the good Lord
To give me a chance and run my mind
I stop trucks and living
Every day we work and pray
Look up at the red neck, what he would give

I rock that camel fashion
The good old boys I was on the move
We got the world asking
Why it is that we do what we do?

We love the outdoors
We got family, faith and friends
This is the red neck's approval
And you stay that way until the very end

We cut them all, yeah
Yeah, we're talking shotguns
We cut them all, yeah
Country boys don't never run

We cut them all, yeah
If it flies, it flies
We cut them all, yeah
Country side, this is how we're living

They call me Boss Hog
Yeah I do it doggie style
Son I do it truck style
It's great to get dirty
Love to get a little mud on me
Yeah, this is just the way we wanted

It's just a family deal
That's how we get a deal
If you don't know
You better ask somebody

This is how our country lives
Red hair can't respect some tears
We're after that
Man, I know the deal

We cut them all, yeah
Yeah, we're talking shotguns
We cut them all, yeah
Country boys don't never run

We cut them all, yeah
If it flies, it flies
We cut them all, yeah
Country side, this is how we live our lives

Yeah, we're talkin' shot guns
Country boys don't never run
If it flies, it flies
Country side, this is how we live our lives'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
