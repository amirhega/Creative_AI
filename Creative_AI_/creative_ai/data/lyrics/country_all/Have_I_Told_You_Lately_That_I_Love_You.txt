Have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one else above you?
Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

For the morning sun and all its glory
Greets the day with hope and comfort too
You fill my life with laughter, somehow make it better
Ease my troubles that's what you do

There's a love divine
And it's yours and it's mine
Like the sun

And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray
To the one, oh, to the one

Have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one else above you?
You fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

There's a love divine
And it's yours and it's mine
Like the sun

And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray
To the one, oh, to the one

Have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one else above you?
You fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

Take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
Oh, take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

Oh, baby, baby, baby
Have I told you lately that I love you?
C'mon baby move with me
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby''''''''''''''''
