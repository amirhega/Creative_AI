Met you in a cafe
At a table meant for two
You were sittin' by your lonesome
And I sat down with you
You tried hard not to show it
But I couldn't help but see
That you wore a broken heart out on your sleeve
And your lonliness
Could not disguise
The beauty and the charm
Thought if I ever get you,
Shattered lady in my arms
I'm gonna rock you, baby, to sleep
I'm gonna make you crazy over me
I wanna hold you
Like you've never been held before
And love you till you tell me
You can't love anymore
I'm gonna shake your emotion
Right down to your soul
And I wanna love you all over
And then out of control
Yeah if this is how love is suppose to feel
Baby I know I've fallin' head over heals
Gonna rock you, baby

Over open conversation
And a bottle of red wine
You said this world is full of users
And I know that I've had mine
We danced a little slow dance,
Until they closed that cafe down
You said what would be the chances
That tonight I've finally found someone
Who makes me, feel like, my life has just begun
I said girl, believe in me, And I'll show you how it's done

I'm gonna rock you baby, to sleep
I'm gonna make you crazy over me
I wanna hold you
Like you've never been held before
And love you till you tell me
You can't love anymore
I'm gonna shake your emotion
Right down to your soul
Then I wanna love you all over
And then out of control
Yeah if this is how love is suppose to feel
Ooh Baby I know I've fallin' ' head over heals
Gonna rock you, baby''''''''''''''''
