Chasing after that dollar like it'll slow down my hurry
Settle all my worries when I get it in my wallet
Quit dipping' long enough to own a pair of jeans
That don't have a ring in the back pocket
Laughing at myself, admitting when I'm wrong
That's what this gold ol' boy's gonna go out workin' on

Workin' on coming to Jesus, kicking the bottle,
Wrestling with our roots,
Trying to turn off Mama's tears, and feel up Daddy's boots
Shutting off our pride, fixing bridges we burned, learning how to live and learn
Keeping our demons down and our trucks up and running
Loving them angels sitting pretty in the middle of 'em
Fighting with the man in the mirror till we gone
Yeah, that's what all us good ol' boys gonna go out workin' on
Gonna go out workin' on

Giving more forgiveness, picking battles worth choosing
Little less cussin' and losin' my temper and my tools
Dialin' down my restless, outgrowing my reckless
And my reputation for breaking hearts and rules
Realizin' what I got what I got before it's gone
That's what this good ol boy's gonna go out
Workin' on...

Workin' on coming to Jesus, kicking the bottle,
Wrestling with our roots,
Trying to turn off Mama's tears, and feel up Daddy's boots
Shutting off our pride, fixing bridges we burned, learning how to live and learn
Keeping our demons down and our trucks up and running
Loving them angels sitting pretty in the middle of 'em
Fighting with the man in the mirror till we gone
Yeah, that's what all us good ol' boys gonna go out workin' on
Gonna go out workin' on

Owning up to my weakness, keeping it humble but strong
Doin' the best I can with this flesh and bone

Workin' on coming to Jesus, kicking the bottle,
Wrestling with our roots,
Trying to turn off Mama's tears, and feel up Daddy's boots
Shutting off our pride, fixing bridges we burned, learning how to live and learn
Keeping our demons down and our trucks up and running
Loving them angels sitting pretty in the middle of 'em
Fighting with the man in the mirror till we gone
Yeah, that's what all us good ol' boys gonna go out workin' on
Gonna go out workin' on''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
