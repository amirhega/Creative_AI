Sometimes when I sleep
I can see you walkin' back to me
Sometimes I wake up
'Cause I swear I felt your touch
Then emotions over come me
And the darkness is so cold

I light a candle, watch it burn
I feel the angels come and fill this room
Oh, when you're gone I miss you so much
I do the only thing I can do
I pray for you
I pray for you

Every minute of the day
I can clearly see your face
And every minute we're apart
Oh, you know it just breaks my heart
I'm so lonely, but I'm OK
'Ccause I know we'll be together again

Oh, I pray for you
Please hold her and protect her
Till she's back here in my arms again
Oh and Tell her how I love her
And I'll be waitin' right here forever, AMEN
I feel the angels come and fill this room
Oh, when you're gone I miss you so much
I do the only thing I can do
I pray for you
I pray for you''''&'''&''&'''&''&'''''''
