If you wanna go back to him, baby, get up and go
I'm tired of being a clown caught up in your sideshow
Night after night, it never ends
It's like a heavyweight fight nobody wins
And I'm throwin' in the towel
Enough is enough

Knock yourself out; break me in two
You gotta go do what you gotta do
I gave you my best shot but you didn't fall
Head over heels in love after all
An' I don't wanna hear no more
Baby, there's the door
There's nothin' left to fight about
Knock yourself out

Oh, let's not pull any punches
While we're standin' here, toe to toe
If you're gonna leave me here, baby, go on
Go

Knock yourself out; break me in two
You gotta go do what you gotta do
I gave you my best shot but you didn't fall
Head over heels in love after all
An' I don't wanna hear no more
Baby, there's the door
There's nothin' left to fight about
Knock yourself out

Oh, knock yourself out

If you wanna go back to him, baby, get up and go''''''''''''''''''''''''
