Candle light, red wine kiss
Never knew it could feel like this
Blown away where lovin' lays
You're everything that I miss

I'd love to kiss you when the sunrise breaks
But if your heart won't let you stay

Don't wake me up before you go
If you gotta leave, I don't wanna know
Let me sleep, tangled in the sheets
Dreaming you're right there next to me
Don't wanna hear your footsteps on that floor
Don't even close my door
Don't wake me, don't wake me, don't wake me up
Don't wake me, don't wake me, don't wake me up

It started slow, now we're moving fast
Lipstick stain on an empty glass
You whisper close in my ear
Oh, I'd love to stay right here

And I wonder girl when we lay down
Will you be here when the sun comes back around?

Don't wake me up before you go
If you gotta leave, I don't wanna know
Let me sleep, tangled in the sheets
Dreaming you're right there next to me
Don't wanna hear your footsteps on that floor
Don't even close my door
Don't wake me, don't wake me, don't wake me up
Don't wake me, don't wake me, don't wake me up

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't wake me up before you go
If you gotta leave, I don't wanna know
Let me sleep, tangled in the sheets
Dreaming you're right there next to me
Don't wanna hear your footsteps on that floor
Don't even close my door
Don't wake me, don't wake me, don't wake me up
Don't wake me, don't wake me, don't wake me up
Don't wake me, don't wake me, don't wake me up'''''&'''&'''&'''&'''&''''''&'''&'
