Bells will be ringing
The glad, glad news
Oh, what a Christmas
To have the blues
My baby's gone
I have no friends
To wish me greetings
Once again

Choirs will be singing
"Silent Night"
Christmas carols
By candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas
Then by New Year's Night

Friends and relations
Send salutations
Sure as the stars shine up above
For this is Christmas
Christmas, my dear
The time of year
To spend with the one you love

Then won't you please tell me
You'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year's
Will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow
No grief or pain
Because it's Christmas
Christmas once again''''''''''''''''
