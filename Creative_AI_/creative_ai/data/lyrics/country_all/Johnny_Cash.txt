Whatcha got

Quit my job, flipped off the boss, took my name of the payroll
I'm outta here man
Picked up my cell, rang my baby's bell, said I'm three miles from home
I said sugar won't you put on that sundress I like so much
Wait out by the road, I'm comin' to pick you up

(Whoa, whoa)
Throw your suitcase in the back
(Whoa, whoa)
Done gassed up the Pontiac
(Whoa, whoa)
Blastin out to Johnny Cash
Headin for the highway, baby we ain't ever comin' back


It's four hundred and sixty seven miles to the outskirts of Las Vegas
What do you say we go get married by a preacher man who looks like Elvis
Yeah Mama
Sugar don't you worry about tellin' your mama goodbye
We'll send her a souvenir postcard from the wild side

(Whoa, whoa)
Throw your suitcase in the back
(Whoa, whoa)
Done gassed up the Pontiac
(Whoa, whoa)
Blastin out to Johnny Cash
Headin for the highway, baby we ain't ever comin' back

(Whoa, whoa)
Throw your suitcase in the back
(Whoa, whoa)
Done gassed up the Pontiac
(Whoa, whoa)
Blastin out to Johnny Cash
Headin for the highway, baby we ain't ever comin' back

(Whoa, whoa)
(Whoa, whoa)
Hear that train a comin', rollin' around the bend
(Whoa, whoa)
The man in black's gonna rock your ass again
Whoa, whoa

Ah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah nah nah''''''''''''''''''
