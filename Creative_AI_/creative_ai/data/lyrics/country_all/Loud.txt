Loosen up, shout it out,
Everybody to the house
Stomp your feet, clap your hands
Come on
Kick it with the band
We're all about tradition
We don't mind the twang
We've got just one condition now

We like it loud
We like it honkin'
The party won't be revvin'
Till we crank it to eleven
Get it rockin'
Our boots are knockin'
We're gonna say it proud
We love our country and we like it loud

Calling all the cowboys,
Don't be scared to make some noise
Think you're bad, think you're strong
C'mon people bring it on
Calling all you sexy mommas
All the girls next door
Don't say we didn't warn you baby

From out in California,
New York to Tennessee
Come on if you're with us
Let us hear you scream

We like it loud
We like it loud
We like it loud
We like it
We like it''''''&''&''&''&''''''
