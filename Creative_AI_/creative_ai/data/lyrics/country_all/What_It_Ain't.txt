I have been around
This old block before
I've walked into
Abruptly closin' doors
Schooled in hard knocks; I've learned a lot
'Bout how a heart can break
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't

It ain't layin in the dark and wonderin' why she hasn't called
And now it's 2 AM
It ain't drivin' by her house to find her wrapped up in the arms
Of your ex-best friend
It ain't bold face lies or alibies that cannot be explained
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't

You say you could
Show me how to love
Baby there's one thing
You can be sure of
I wouldn't treat you wrong 'cause I've been on
The hurtin' side of pain
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't

It ain't showin' up for dinner with a rose and Chardonnay
Then drinkin' by yourself
It ain't a postcard from Hawaii sayin' we can still be friends
But I met someone else
It ain't bold faced lies or alibis that cannot be explained
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't

It ain't a mink coat,
Forty pairs of shoes,
Two 14-carat anklets on my Mastercard.
It ain't walkin' in a pawn shop,
Recognizing her engagement ring,
She swore she lost.
It ain't bold face lies or alibis,
That cannot be explained.
I might not know what love is,
But I know what it ain't.

If you had all day I could tell you things
That would make a grown man faint
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't
Yeah, I know what it ain't'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
