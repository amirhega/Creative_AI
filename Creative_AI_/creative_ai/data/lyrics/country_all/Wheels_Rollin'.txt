Counting the lines on a highway road
Mile one by one
Flying through the midnight rain
Like a bullet from a gun

I lay down but I can't sleep
'Cause I still feel the band
Still on a high from the crowd in the lights
With a cold one in my hand

Singing
Here I go, down this road
Another town, another state
I wouldn't have it any other way
All I want, is to sing my songs
Hearing that crowd, keeps me going
Guitars rocking, wheels rolling

I step up, the lights go down
I hear that first chord ring
It's where I go to lose myself
Forget about everything

It's my home away from home
Hanging with my friends
It's a crazy life, but every night
I get to do it again and again and again

Here I go, down this road
Another town, another state
I wouldn't have it any other way
All I want, is to sing my songs
Hearing that crowd, keeps me going
Guitars rocking, wheels rolling

Here I go, down this road
Another town, another state
I wouldn't have it any other way
All I want, is to sing my songs
Hearing that crowd, keeps me going
Guitars rocking, wheels rolling

Here I go
On down this road
Don't you know
I wouldn't have it any other way'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
