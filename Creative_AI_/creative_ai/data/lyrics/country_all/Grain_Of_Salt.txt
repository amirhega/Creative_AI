Yeah, when I came to, you were standin' by the foot of the bed.
I was still hung over an' my eyes were bloodshot red.
Did you think things were gonna be different?
Did you think you tore my heart apart?
'Cause you can see, there's more pain in my head,
Than down in this old broken heart.

I took your leavin' with a grain of salt,
Tequila an' a slice of lime.
Yeah, the minute you left, 
Me an' the boys went out an' had a real good time.
It's nice of you to check up on me,
Just to see how I was gettin' along.
But I'd already gotten over it, baby,
'Fore you were even gone.

By now, you've observed, I was a little over-served last night.
I need to catch a few z's, baby, please:
Turn off that bedroom light.
See the boys are comin' by to get me:
We're gonna take our little show into town.
I need my rest 'cause they'll be doin' their best,
To burn another juke joint down.

I took your leavin' with a grain of salt,
Tequila an' a slice of lime.
Yeah, the minute you left, 
Me an' the boys went out an' had a real good time.
It's nice of you to check up on me,
Just to see how I was gettin' along.
But I'd already gotten over it, baby,
'Fore you were even gone.

Yeah, I'd already gotten way over it, baby,
'Fore you were even gone.
Gone.
Bye now.''''''''''''''''''
