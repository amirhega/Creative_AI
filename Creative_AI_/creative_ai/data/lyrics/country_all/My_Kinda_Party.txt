I worked all week
Cleaned up, clean cut, and clean shaved
Got the cover off a '68
I fired it up, and let them horses sing
A little pretty thing

A little tan leg Georgia dream
She's a rockin' them holey jeans
Baby, what you got goin' on Saturday?
You know, words got it, there's gonna be a party,
Out of town about half a mile
Four wheel drives and big mud tires
Muscadine wine

Oh baby, you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sittin' 'round watchin' all these pretty things
I get down in that Georgia clay

And I'll find peace
In the bottom of a real tall cold drink
Chillin' with some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It's my kind of party

Well if you wanna drink
Go on baby, just do your thing
But give up your keys
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while we'll sneak away from the bonfire

Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside
Gotcha sippin' on the moonshine
Baby, if you're in mood and you can settle for a one night rodeo
If you can be my tan-legged Juliet
I'll be your Redneck Romeo

Oh baby, you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sittin' 'round watchin' all these pretty things
I get down in that Georgia clay

And I'll find peace
In the bottom of a real tall cold drink
Chillin' with some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It's my kind of party

Oh baby, you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sittin' 'round watchin' all these pretty things
I get down in that Georgia clay

And I'll find peace
In the bottom of a real tall cold drink
Chillin' with some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It's my kind of party

Haha, y'all ready for this?
Y'all go head and turn it on up''''''''''''''''''
