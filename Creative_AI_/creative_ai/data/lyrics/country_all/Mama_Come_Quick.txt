I straddled my bicycle
When I was 10 years old
Rode it up on maxwell hill where all the big boys go

Way down in the bottom
There's a creekbed six feet wide
And if you peddle fast enough you can make
The other side...

Mama come quick
I think I fell...
And hurt myself again
Mama come quick
You know too well...
How much I still depend on you
Pickin' me up
And dustin me off...
Sending me on my way...
Cause nothin' heals as much...
As your lovin' touch...

I fell in love for the first time
When I was almost grown
I'd heard that love could hurt real bad
Though I had not been shown...
Everybody told me
She would only break my heart...
But I wouldn't listen to them
'Cause I was way too smart

Mama come quick
I think I fell
And hurt myself again
Mama come quick
You know too well
How much I still depend
On you pickin' me up
And dustin me off
And sendin me on my way
Cause nothin' heals as much
As your lovin' touch

Yeah daddies teach us how to ride
And how to catch and throw
But when things don't go the way they should
A boy knows
Where to go

Mama come quick
I think I fell
And hurt myself again
Mama come quick
You know too well
How much I still depend on you
Pickin' me up
And dustin me off
And sendin me on my way
Cause nothin' heals as much
As your lovin' touch

Yeah Mama come quick
(Mama come quick)
I need your lovin' touch
Oh Mama come quick
(Mama come quick)
I need your lovin' touch...''''''''''''''''''
