Mama locked the door last night for the first time in all of her years
I said mama you gotta be kidding me
She said things ain't like they used to be round here
You just wouldn't believe it, kids growing up without Jesus
Good thing your daddy ain't here to see this now
They stay higher than the water tower in this 35 MPH Town

She said it ain't the drugs, it ain't the booze
I've had a backroad buzz or two, myself
It seems like heaven is slipping further away
The devil ain't got far to go when they raise hell
We used to burn a hole through midnight
Smoking a stolen Marlboro Light and on a good night
Might kill a 5th of Crown
But now there's a lower higher power in this 35 MPH town

Oh we can't blame the babies for growing up lazy
And crazy it ain't them that let them down
If they ain't stealing, they're suing
Why work when we'll give it to 'em
It's right there in the bible we don't put out
Spare the rod and you'll sour a 35 MPH town

The "yes mam's" gone and the "please's" too,
It's out the door with the "thank you" in the evening
You don't see a front yard football game
The neighbor kids have done away with the shirt and skins
No one hits the front porch lights to get the kids to come inside
Cause the streets ain't safe for a bike to ride down
Since they planted a prowler in this 35 MPH town
No they're going nowhere fast tonight
No matter how fast they drive this 35 MPH Town''''''''''''''''''
