Do you remember when we snuck out of the house at the stroke of midnight
I was waitin' 'round the block 'cause your daddy would have killed me if he'd a seen me
You jumped in my ride, we made a beeline out of town
And I drove so fast, yeah I drove so fast

We were rollin' down an open road
With the top laid back and the stars all shining
Headed down to Mexico you were kissing my neck, yeah you had me flying
Rockin' to the radio, you in that short crop tank top dressed to kill
One hand on you, one on the wheel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel
That's the way a night should feel

That was such a long time ago yeah I'll never know how we made it
You're still that same wild child and I don't take your love for granted
So let's jump in my ride, make a beeline out of town
And do it all again yeah like back when

We were rollin' down an open road
With the top laid back and the stars all shining
Headed down to Mexico you were kissing my neck, yeah you had me flying
Rockin' to the radio, you in that short crop tank top dressed to kill
One hand on you, one on the wheel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel
The way a night should feel

When you're all about me and I'm all about you
Baby right now all I want to do, let's go

Rollin' down an open road
With the top laid back and the stars all shining
Headed down to Mexico, keep kissing my neck 'cause it keeps me flying
Rockin' to the radio, you in that short crop tank top dressed to kill
One hand on you, one on the wheel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel
The way a night should feel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel'''''''''''''''''''''''
