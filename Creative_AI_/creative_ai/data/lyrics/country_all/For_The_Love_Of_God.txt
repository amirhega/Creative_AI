Some folks will do anything for money
Cheat and lie and steal
Won't even take the time to go to church on Sunday
But they got plenty of time to make a deal

Please forgive me if I ever act like that
That ain't the way I wanna be
I pray every night that everything I do be for the love of God
For the love of God is why I try so hard
I ain't tryin' to win the praise of man
I live for the love of God

Some people only want to have a good time
Drinking and carryin' on
They get behind the wheel and the next thing you know
Somebody's child is gone

Please forgive me if I ever act like that
That ain't the way I wanna be
I pray every night that everything I do be for the love of God
For the love of God is why I try so hard
I ain't tryin' to win the praise of man
I live for the love of God

For the love of God is why I try so hard
I ain't tryin' to win the praise of man
I live for the love of God

I ain't tryin' to win the praise of man
I live for the love of God''''''''''''''''''
