Well I grew up in one of them old farm towns
Where they hit it hard till the sun goes down
Nobody really seemed to care that we were living in the middle of nowhere
We just figured that's how it was
And everybody else was just like us
Soaking in the rain baking in the sun
Don't quit till the job gets done

That's the only way I know
Don't stop till everything's gone
Straight ahead never turn round
Don't back up, don't back down

Full throttle wide open
You get tired, you don't show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can't dig no more
That's the only way I know

That old red dirt the first thing you learn
You don't get nothing that you don't earn
Humble pride that I grew up on
You find out just how bad you want it

Sun in our eyes backs to the fences
Didn't know the odds were against us
Hit the wall smoking and spinning
Still wasn't thinking 'bout nothing but winning

That's the only way I know
Don't stop till everything's gone
Straight ahead never turn round
Don't back up, don't back down

Full throttle wide open
You get tired, you don't show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can't dig no more
That's the only way I know

Maybe there's another path that will get you there a little bit faster,
But I'm sticking with the one inside of me.

That's the only way I know
Don't stop till everything's gone
Straight ahead never turn round
Don't back up, don't back down

Full throttle wide open
You get tired, you don't show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can't dig no more
That's the only way I know''''''''''''''''
