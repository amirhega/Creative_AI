I've been a drifter most all my life
Just a restless renegade that can't be tied
I am gambler a dangerous rambler
Keep these steel wheels rollin' and a six string by my side
Gotta bottle by my bed
To drown the voices in my head
That try to steer me clear of doin' wrong
If you play with fire they say
You're gonna get burned one day
Hell, I already feel a heat wave comin' on

I know I'm livin' on borrowed time
Livin' like a rebel playin' outlaw music
Havin' the time of my life
Better lock me up throw away the key
If you call that a crime
'Cause that's the way I'll do it till I die
Livin' on borrowed time

There's ain't no lady that could ever save me
Made myself a vow that I'd never cross that line
It might be a mistake, that's just the path I take
But there's room for two if you wanna take the ride''''''''''''''''''
