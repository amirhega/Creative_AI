There's a mighty battle coming and it's well now on its way.
It'll be fought at Armageddon, it shall be a sad, sad day.
In the Book of Revelation, words in chapter sixteen say
There'll be gathered there great armies for that battle on that day.

All the way from the gates of Eden to the Battle of Armageddon
There's been troubles and tribulation, there'll be sorrow and despair.
He has said "Be ye not troubled for these things shall come to pass."
Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with Him atlast.

Turn the pages of your Bible, in St. Matthew you will see,
Start with chapter twenty-four and read from one to thirty-three.
In our Savior's blessed words He said on earth, He prophesised,
For He spoke of this great battle that is coming by and by.

All the way from the gates of Eden to the Battle of Armageddon
There's been troubles and tribulation, there'll be sorrow and despair.
He has said "Be ye not troubled for these things shall come to pass."
Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with Him atlast.

There'll be nation against nation, there'll be war and rumor of war.
There'll be great signs in Heaven, in the sun, the moon, the stars.
Oh, the hearts of men shall fail them, there'll be gnashing of the teeth.
Those who seek it will receive it, mercy at the Savior's feet.

All the way from the gates of Eden to the Battle of Armageddon
There's been troubles and tribulation, there'll be sorrow and despair.
He has said "Be ye not troubled for these things shall come to pass."
Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with Him atlast.''''''''''''''''''
