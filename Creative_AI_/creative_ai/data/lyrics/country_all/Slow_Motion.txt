I got a crack in my windshield
I know exactly how it feels
It's comin' apart the hard way
It gets a little more shattered each day

Oh oh oh, I'm braking in slow motion
Oh oh oh, how did it hit me so fast?
It hurts so bad, it hurts so bad
Somebody tell me how long will this last?
'Cause oh oh oh, I'm braking in slow motion

Feels like I'm frozen in a dream
I can't run, can't even scream
I'm trying to fight but I can't get my fist up
How does somebody get so messed up?

Let go, let go
Why can't I make myself do it
I don't know
Oh...

Oh oh oh, I'm braking in slow motion''''&'''&''&'''&''&'''''''
