I heard Davey Crockett had a pint in his pocket
Good whiskey at the Alamo
Now that Pancho Villia had a jug of Tequila
When he walked the streets of old Mexico
While Blackbeard was fleecing around the hurricane season
He didn't quit because of a girl
Yeah, rum is the reason pirates never ruled the world

While Russia was brawling, I bet that Old Stalin
Was calling for a Vodka martina
While the world waited in fear, Old Hitler drank beer
From a stein, eating sauerkraut and weenies
Yeah, down through the ages, as they're turning the pages
They couldn't drink their diamonds and pearls
No, rum is the reason pirates never ruled the world

I ain't getting much done but I'm having fun
Sailing on the deep blue sea
My whole body goes numb from a bottle of dark rum
And the sun sinking down on me
My catch of the day is a tall Cuba Libra
Chased down with a 12 oz curl
Yeah, rum is the reason pirates never ruled the world

I ain't getting much done but I'm having fun
Sailing on the deep blue sea
My whole body goes numb from a bottle of dark rum
And the sun sinking down on me
My catch of the day is a tall Cuba Libra
Chased down with a 12 oz curl
Oh, rum is the reason I guess
Hey, rum is the reason pirates never ruled the world

Take it home coral reefers, haha...''''''''''''''''''''
