I drove half way to town last night
And I turned around
In a field of fireflies makin' such a lonely sound
As my headlights flashed on a mailbox by the road
I realized that I was livin' in a new zip code

Well I'm livin' in Lonesome USA
Population one since yesterday
Livin' and dyin' in the hell I made
Since you been gone
Right now my mind's in another state
Ain't enough heart here left to break
I'm livin' in Lonesome, Lonesome USA

I never knew the sound of silence could be so loud
It's hard getting used to livin' in an empty house
Yeah I know I can come and go any time I please
But there's somethin' I miss about
You waitin' up on me

Well I'm livin' in Lonesome USA
Population one since yesterday
Livin' and dyin' in the hell I made
Since you been gone
Right now my mind's in another state
Ain't enough heart here left to break
I'm livin' in Lonesome, Lonesome USA

Hey I could drive all night
And be right here where I am
And still be just as lost till you come back
Hey I look around here an it don't take long to see
Oh where I am right now's the only place to be

Lonesome USA
Population one since yesterday
Livin' and dyin' in the hell I made
Since you been one
Right now my mind's in another state
Ain't enough heart here left to break
I'm livin' in Lonesome, Lonesome USA
Hey I'm livin' in Lonesome, Lonesome USA
Hey I'm livin' in Lonesome, Lonesome USA''''''''''''''''''
