Brothers And Sisters!
Thank you, Thank you so much.
We have come so far. Yet we have so very far to come.
Prejudice should not exist in this world.
Therefore prejudice, by all means should not exist in music.
There is only good, and better!
Therefore we present to you our dear friends, our families, our best our very best.
We pour out our passions, our hearts and our souls.
So that you may become, a little closer to the music that is Big and Rich!''''&''&''&''&''&''&''&''
