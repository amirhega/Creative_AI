All my life I've been so lonesome
If happpiness came, I missed the call
All my dreams have died and vanished
And now I'm so tired of it all.

In life and love, I've been a failure
Too many tears through it all
Too many broken vows and promises
And now I'm so tired of it all.

Ev'ry thing I loved, I lost, dear
Too many times I've watched my castles fall
My life is full of regretting
And now I'm so tired of it all.

From this world I'll soon be goin'
No one will miss me, after all
Up there, I pray I'll find contentment
But now I'm so tired of it all.'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
