No candle light, no wine
No plans and that's just fine
Just put your hand in mine
Nothin' fancy

Don't need no party dress
I like you just like this
Just like the night we met
Nothin' fancy

Girl, this is everything
I'm looking for
There's nothing you could do
To make me want you more

So I hope it's still okay
That when I feel this way
"I love you" is all I say
Nothin' fancy

Girl, this is everything
I'm looking for
There's nothing you could do
To make me want you more

So I hope it's still okay
That when I feel this way
"I love you" is all I say
Nothin' fancy'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
