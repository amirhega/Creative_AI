Lord things have changed since we first met
We been down a long road that's filled with regret
It's hard to forget and even harder to forgive
Torn between love and what I need to live
Darling I wish I could be more than I am
Just and old cowboy and almost a broken man
But everything I love I lose
Bulls and broncs, broken bones and booze
Seemed to me the only way that I know
I've hit bottom baby girl nowhere else to go
It's hard to see right when all you've done is wrong
Hard to hang on when all you got is gone
This cowboy life gave me a heart of stone
This cowboy life tore up our home
This cowboy life is all I've ever known
This cowboy life has left me all alone

Never thought it would happen like this
Never thought it was you I'd miss
Came around and touched my soul
I put all my plans on hold
Everything is falling down
Thought you would have come around
Can't you see what's goin' on?
It's so hard to hang on

When I start to fall asleep
I think of how we used to be
You're in my heart you're in my soul
You're everything I've ever known
I think about you all the time
Don't you know that I'd give my life
To have you stand next to me
Right here by my side

Never thought it would happen like this
Never thought it was you I'd miss
Came around and touched my soul
I put all my plans on hold
Everything is falling down
Thought you would have come around
Can't you see what's goin' on?
It's so hard to hang on

Where did we go wrong? What did we do right?
Tell me it's all right to push our pride aside
Life without you ain't what I thought it would be
When you lying there with here do you ever wish it was me?
Can you forgive me for everything I did and didn't do?
Understand this way of life is all I ever knew
I was raised to be tough, keep my feelings inside
Never to back down, all you have is your pride
I know what it takes to cover the whole ()
But being a one woman man was never part of my plan
Life without love is just another sad song
Doin' all that I can but it's hard to hang on

All we have in life is love
But you never even gave none
So now I'm standing on my own
Don't really care if you ever come home

Never thought it would happen like this
Never thought it was you I'd miss
Came around and touched my soul
I put all my plans on hold
Everything is falling down
Thought you would have come around
Can't you see what's goin' on?
It's so hard to hang on''''''''''''''''''
