Some had on the Rebel grey, Some the Union blue,
They were fathers, sons, and brothers, men like me and you.
Engaged in heavy battle, till there came that cloudy draw,
When silence took the battlefield men just stood in awe.

Some say it was the cannon smoke, some say the Northern lights,
That cast a ghostly image over Fredricksburg that night,
Some say it was God's spirit lookin' o'er the bloody sod,
But that rainbow mist that filled the sky, was the tears of God.

Both sides read his Holy Word and believed it in their hearts,
But the common ground He'd blessed them with, had now been torn apart.
Covered by the blood they shed, so many lost their lives,
The fight on that Virginia hill was enough to make Him cry.

Some say it was the cannon smoke, some say the Northern lights,
That cast a ghostly image over Fredricksburg that night,
Some say it was God's spirit looking o'er the bloody sod,
But the rainbow mist that filled the sky, was the tears of God.

Some say it was the cannon smoke some say the Northern lines,
That cast a ghostly image over Fredricksburg that night,
Some say it was God's spirit lookin' o'er the bloody sod,
But the Rainbow mist that filled the sky, was the tears of God.''''''''''''''''
