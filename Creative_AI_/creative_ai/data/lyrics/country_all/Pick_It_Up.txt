I put a fishing rod by your bed
Right next to a Bible
I leaned a guitar in the corner of your room
With some Milsap on vinyl
I figured the best thing I could do was put a thing or two
And that it wouldn't hurt to have in your way, on your path

Hoping you might pick it up one day
And you might learn a couple pretty cool things
That I love to do
Then you can take it and spin it, and fit it
I don't know what you gonna be
But I hope you smile when you think of me
'Cause I helped make you
But I didn't never try to make you pick it up
You just pick it up, pick it up

Early to rise, headin' to work
Open a door for a stranger
Yes sir, yes Mama, red dirt on my hands
Showing you the best way I can

So you might pick it up one day
And you might learn a couple pretty cool things
That I love to do
Then you can take it and spin it, and fit it
I don't know what you gonna be
But I hope you smile when you think of me
'Cause I helped make you
But I didn't never try to make you pick it up
Yeah, you just pick it up

Dancing and kissing your Mama in the kitchen
Treatin' her like a princess, hoping you might pick it up one day
Hoping you might learn a couple pretty cool things
That I love to do
Then you can take it and spin it, and fit it
I don't know what you gonna be
But I hope you smile when you think of me
'Cause I helped make you
But I didn't never try to make you pick it up
Yeah, you just pick it up, pick it up
You just pick it up, pick it up, yeah

I hope you pick it up
You just pick it up''''''''''''''''''
