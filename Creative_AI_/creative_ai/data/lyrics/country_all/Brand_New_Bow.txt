Thought I'd call you up an' see if you had celebrated,
Day you were born: It's a little belated.
Age is just a number an' it's really over-rated to me. 
Yeah, November 3rd: that's a day I remember,
'Cause its thirty-seven days after mine in September.
You'd thought I forgot 'cause here it is: December again. 

Oh, happy birthday, baby, wanna to see you tonight.
I got your present waitin', I wanna do it right.
I ain't got enough money for a big diamond ring:
Let's tie a brand new bow around the same old thing.

(Yeah.)
(Now blow out your candles.) 

Yeah, happy birthday, baby, wanna to see you tonight.
I got your present waitin', I wanna do it right.
I ain't got enough money for a big diamond ring:
Let's tie a brand new bow around the same old thing.''''''''''''''''''
