I left my home in Georgia
Took a dream and a dollar
Went looking for that fortune and fame
Well I found it up in Nashville
With the guitars and the fiddles
Started singing 'cross the U.S. of A
I'd played my songs in Georgia
Way down there in Florida
Once or twice in New Orleans
But the sounds I was making
Didn't know that I'd be taking them to places that's so far and strange
But the people really dug it no matter where we strummed it
I felt that it would be ok
'Cause I learned right away
It ain't just a southern thang

Now I've played in Chicago and Western Colorado
And we kicked 'em dead in Sante Fe
Sung in North and South Dakota
And Eastern Oklahoma
And a TV show out in LA
They got the hats and boots
And them country roots
No matter what state they claim
Yeah the facts are plain
It ain't just a southern thang, y'all

I've seen cowgirls a plenty
Up in New York City
Milwaukee and in Philly PA
They got the four wheel drives on that Minnesota ice
Just like they have in Alabam A
They're dancing and they're moving
To the lyrics and the music
From Maui up to Bangor Maine
Lord it may sound strange
But it ain't just a southern thang

Yeah I've played up in Chicago and Western Colorado
And we kicked 'em dead in Sante Fe
Sung in North and South Dakota
And Eastern Oklahoma
And a TV show out in LA
They got the hats and boots
And them country roots
No matter what state they claim
The facts are plain
It ain't just a southern thang

I've played that country music
On the land and the ocean
But people can't say my name
Yeah the fact remains
It ain't just a southern thang

Oh I've played up in Chicago and Western Colorado
And we kicked 'em dead in Sante Fe
Sung in North and South Dakota
And Eastern Oklahoma
And a TV show out in LA
They got the hats and boots
And country roots
No matter what state they claim
The facts are plain
It ain't just a southern thang
Oh it may sound strange
It ain't just a southern thang
Yeah the fact remains
It ain't just a southern thang, y'all'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
