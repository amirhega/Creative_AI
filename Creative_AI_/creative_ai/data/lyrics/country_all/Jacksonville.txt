It wasn't even in my plan
A week in the sun and some fun in the sand
I was really only passing through
It all began on Ocean Drive
Standin' in line for a burger and fries
Coincidently, so were you
We took a quiet corner booth

Didn't plan on hangin' out in Florida
Never was to good at standin still
Suddenly it's lookin' like I'm gonna
Kill a few more days in Jacksonville

I'm givin' up my walkin' shoes
While the wind and the waves wash away my blues
And you help me lose track of time
Rock and roll, your holdin' me
Rockin' in your arms by a rollin' sea
It was easy makin' up my mind
I can see forever in your eyes, your eyes

Didn't plan on hangin' out in Florida
Never was to good at standin still
Suddenly it's lookin' like I'm gonna
Kill a few more days in Jacksonville

Didn't plan on hangin' out in Florida
Never was to good at standin still
Suddenly it's lookin' like I'm gonna
Kill a few more days in Jacksonville

Kill a few more days in Jacksonville''''''''''''''''''
