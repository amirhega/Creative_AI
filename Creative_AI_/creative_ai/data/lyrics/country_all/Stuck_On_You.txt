I hear you found one
Heard hes a good one
Livin' out all your dreams
Give it some time girl
You'll come to find
You shoulda just stuck with me

When it don't work out
And then he walks out
Before you look for number 3
Stop for a second
Maybe you'll reckon
You shoulda just stuck with me

I know I ain't perfect but least I've learned
Id do anything for you
You might believe that your over me
But I'm still stuck on you

I keep on hopin
You had to go just so you could spread your wings
But come some sunrise
You'll come to realize
You shoulda just stuck with me

I know I ain't perfect but least I've learned
Id do anything for you
You might believe that your over me
But I'm still stuck on you

Were gonna look back
Were gonna laugh bout
Our ups and downs and in betweens
When you said goodbye and then you realized
Shoulda just stuck with me

Give it some time girl
You'll come to find''''''''''''''''
