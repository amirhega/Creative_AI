You boys ever met a real country girl?
I'm talkin' true blue, out in the woods, down home, country

She's a hot little number in her pick-up truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party-all-nighter from South Carolina
A bad mammajama from down in Alabama
She's a ragin Cajun, lunatic from Brunswick, juicy Georgia peach
With a thick southern drawl, sexy swingin' walk, brother she's all

Country, (shoot) from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayers she prays,
That's the way she was born and raised, she ain't afraid to stay, country
Brother she's country

A hell raisin sugar when the sun goes down
Mama taught her how to rip up the town
Honey drippin honey from the holler in Kentucky
Getcha flippin kinda trippie like a Mississippi hippie
She's a Kansas princess, crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swingin' walk
Brother she's all

Country (shoot) from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayers she prays,
That's the way she was born and raised, ain't afraid to stay, country
Nothin' but country

(Thick southern drawl... sexy swing and walk)

Aw show 'em how a country girl does it one time now

Brother she's country, from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
Nothin' but country
Yeah yeayeaaa
She's country, (shoot) from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayers she prays,
That's the way she was born and raised she ain't afraid to stay, country
Yeah she's nothin' but country

She's all about the country
From the backwoods, she's a homegrown, down to the bone, she's country''''''''''''''''''''''''
