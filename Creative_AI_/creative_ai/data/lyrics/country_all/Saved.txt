Was a time I tried to kill a man
Just a lookin' at me wrong
Anger so strong, I couldn't stop myself

Well I was killin' myself one shot at a time
Goin' insane from the pain, the women, and the wine

But I fin'lly hit bottom in an alleyway
Hell wasn't but a breath away
So I hit my knees in the street and begged God for mercy

Last night
I told the devil where to go
You know heaven's got my soul
Ain't gonna listen to his lies no more

Last night, I told the devil where to go

I coulda saved myself a lotta hurtin' time
If I'da just listened to my mamma, every time she cried
Well I was way too lost in a sinners haze
Burnin' up the days,
Just another young man who had lost his way

Now it finally makes sense what the preacher said
When he said "Son, you don't wanna wake up dead,
And find yourself alone in the fires of hell."

Yeah everybody
Last night, I told the devil where to go

Now when you hear that demon knockin' at your door
You just tell him you don't want his hide 'round here no more
'Cause if you wanna love, if you wanna live, if you wanna be free,
You can't forget and forgive,
You gotta kick him in the teeth and do exactly,
Do exactly what I did
Yeah

Last night, I told the devil
Last night, I told the devil
Last night, I told the devil
Last night, I told the devil
Last night, I told the devil
I told the devil where to go''''''&''&''&''&''''''
