I grew up in South Carolina
Singing all them bluegrass and country songs
I'd sing from Hannah down to Charlestowne
Getting all the people to sing along to what I call

South Carolina low country
Southern words with an old Sandlapper tune
Palmetto trees swaying in that Atlantic breeze
Reaching up to touch the crescent moon
South Carolina low country
Is the music that comes outta me

I remember standing in the warm sunshine
Working my fingers to the bone
Singing as I suckered down that ole drag row
I came up with a music all my own it;s what I call

South Carolina low country
Southern words with an old Sandlapper tune
Palmetto trees swaying in that Atlantic breeze
Reaching up to touch the crescent moon
South Carolina low country
Is the music that comes outta me

God bless Wade Hampton and The Swamp Fox
Their strength will stand the test of time
They fought for a flag, a state, and a way of life
Because of that you will always find me singing my

South Carolina low country
Oh, the sound in my heart will always be
South Carolina low country
That's the music that comes outta me
It's the music coming outta me''''''''''''''''''
