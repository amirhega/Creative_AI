Got the visor down drivin' into the sunset
Ain't come up on your dirt road turn yet
This Chevrolet is 5 away
Just enough time to burn half a cigarette
Can't wait to see what's waitin' on me
Behind that screen door I bet it'll be
Somethin' I can't take my eyes off
Somethin' you can't wait to show off
Baby, this ain't no lay low kinda night I'm talkin' about
When you get everything just the way you like it
Come walkin' out we

Get these wheels rollin' down the road
Find us a couple cold beers to hold
Let that moonlight kiss your skin
Like I'm about to do again and again
Don't matter where we set the party down
Underneath the stars or the lights of town
In a car in a bar girl when this night ends
Let's make it one of the ones we won't forget

You been soakin' up that sunshine all day
Sendin' some hot little pictures my way
Soakin' wet gettin' in my head
Now you're in that dress and girl I can't wait to
Take you out, spin you around
Find somewhere to lay you down
But the first thing we gotta do right now is

Get these wheels rollin' down the road
Find us a couple cold beers to hold
Let that moonlight kiss your skin
Like I'm about to do again and again
Don't matter where we set the party down
Underneath the stars or the lights of town
In a car in a bar girl when this night ends
Let's make it one of the ones we won't forget

Baby, this ain't no lay low kinda night I'm talkin' about
It's a missin' you all day kinda thing gotta make every second count when we

Get these wheels rollin' down the road
Find us a couple cold beers to hold
Let that moonlight kiss your skin
Like I'm about to do again and again
Don't matter where we set the party down
Underneath the stars or the lights of town
In a car in a bar girl when this night ends
Let's make it one of the ones we won't forget
Yeah, one we won't forget
Yeah''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
