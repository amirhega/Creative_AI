I'm gonna slide on down
Pull my bull rope tight
Gonna get wild and western
Out here tonight

Drew Kathmandu
A good bull to ride
I spur the lot
And I'm ready to rock
Let's go outside

And the world explodes
As they open up my chute
And the crowd goes wild
When they turn this bad boy loose
Ain't gonna go down, down, down
On the Soul Side of Wonder
I'm a big bull rider
Yeah, a big bull rider

And the world explodes
As they open up my chute
And the crowd goes wild
When they turn this bad boy loose
Ain't gonna go down, down, down
On the Soul Side of Wonder
I'm a big bull rider
Yeah, a big bull rider

Yeah, a big bull rider''''''''''''''''''
