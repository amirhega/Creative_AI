Crushed, smoked, twisted up
And burned like a cigarette
Tossed away
In the rain with no regret
I've been dying on
The bad side of a goodbye
One fall away from the edge
When you kissed me back to life

Thank God for pain
'Cause I never would've known
That love could feel this way
And I know it sounds insane
But thank God for scars
'Cause every jagged little one
Got me closer to where we are
And if I hadn't been ripped apart
I never would've kissed your face
Thank God for pain

I was left, I was lost
Heartbroke, down, and out of luck
I was used, all confused
I was covered up and black and blue
If I'd never known that hurt
Or felt that misery
I'd have never known baby
How much you mean to me

Thank God for pain
'Cause I never would've known
That love could feel this way
And I know it sounds insane
But thank God for scars
'Cause every jagged little one
Got me closer to where we are
And if I hadn't been ripped apart
I never would've kissed your face
Thank God for pain''''&''&''&''&''&''''&''&
