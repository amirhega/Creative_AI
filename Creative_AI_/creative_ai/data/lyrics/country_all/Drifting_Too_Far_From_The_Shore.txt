Out on the perilous deep
Where dangers silently creep
And storms so violently sweep
You're drifting to far from the shore

Drifting too far from the shore (from the shore)

You're drifting to far from the shore

Today the tempest rolls high
And clouds overshadow the sky
Sure death is hovering nigh
You're drifting to far from the shore

Why meet a terrible fate
Mercy abundantly waits
Turn back before its to late
You're drifting to far from the shore''''''''''''''''''
