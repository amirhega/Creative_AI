My friend Mark called, just to let me know
'Bout a half naked woman doing the show
On Channel 10, plug your video in

I said, "What you gonna do with the rock 'n' roll queen?
Can't close your eyes and kiss the TV screen"
If you know what I mean

'Cause I've got a woman that's soft to hold
But it that ain't love by remote control

Move over Madonna, give it up, Baby Lou
She'd never been rich, never been famous like you
She's hot on the bottom, hot on top
Ain't in vogue, man, she's a rock
Move over Madonna, give it up, Baby Lou

She's got a lot of body for a gal her size
Warm red lips, cool blue eyes
Thrill me, simply thrills me

The black limousine is my old car
Music is a fiddle and a cryin' steel guitar
Down at the roadside bar

She's country blessed with the southern rock
I've got her picture on every wall

Move over Madonna, give it up, Baby Lou
She'd never been rich, never been famous like you
She's hot on the bottom, hot on top
Ain't in vogue, man, she's a rock
Move over Madonna, give it up, Baby Lou

Yeah, I've got a woman that's soft to hold
But it that ain't love by remote control

Move over Madonna, give it up, Baby Lou
She'd never been rich, never been famous like you
She's hot on the bottom, hot on top
Ain't in vogue, man, she's a rock
Move over Madonna, give it up, Baby Lou

Move over Madonna, move over Madonna
Move over Madonna, give it up, Baby Lou

Move over Madonna, move over Madonna
Move over Madonna, give it up, Baby Lou

Move over Madonna, move over Madonna
Move over Madonna, give it up, Baby Lou''''''''''''''''''
