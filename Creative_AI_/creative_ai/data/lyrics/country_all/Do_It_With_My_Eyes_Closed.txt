I busted my knuckles all day in the hot sun
B-burned me up
But I wrapped that chain around that big black motor
Finally pulled it out of my truck

I took a little break, sitting in the shade
Trying to catch my breath
Well, baby, I'm afraid, one of these days
I'ma work myself to death

But loving you is so easy
I can do it with my eyes closed, baby
Day and night, night and day, sound asleep, wide awake
Loving you is something I know
And I can do it with my eyes closed, baby

Well, baby, I could have never made it through college
I barely got my G.E.D
I don't know why but things in life
They come twice as hard for me

I fight my way through work all day
Till I get home to you
When I walk through that door I know
What I was born to do

But loving you is so easy
I can do it with my eyes closed, baby
Day and night, night and day, sound asleep, wide awake
Loving you is something I know
And I can do it with my eyes closed,

You make me feel like a genius
Like I'm Superman
Everything comes naturally
It falls right into my hands

Loving you is so easy
I can do it with my eyes closed, baby
Day and night, night and day, sound asleep, wide awake
Loving you is something I know
And I can do it with my eyes closed, baby

Day and night, night and day, sound asleep, wide awake
Loving you is something I know
And I can do it with my eyes closed, baby
I can do it with my eyes closed''''''''''''''''''
