I see your mama, and the candles and tears and roses
I see your daddy walk his daughter down the isle
I feel my knees start to tremble as I tell the preacher
Don't she look beautiful tonight
All the wonderful words in my head I've been thinking
You know I want to say 'em all just right
I lift your veil, and angels start singing
Such a heavenly sight, yeah

Lost in this moment with you
I am completely consumed
My feelings so absolute, there's no doubt
Sealing our love with a kiss
Waitin' my whole life for this
Watching all my dreams come true
Lost in this moment with you, yeah

I smell the jasmine floating in the air like a love song
Watch my words draw sweet tears from your eyes
Bow our heads while the preacher talks to Jesus
Please bless this brand new life, yeah

Lost in this moment with you
I am completely consumed
My feelings so absolute, there's no doubt
Sealing our love with a kiss
Waitin' my whole life for this
Watching all my dreams come true
Lost in this moment with you, yeah

Lost in this moment with you
I am completely consumed
My feelings so absolute, there's no doubt
Sealing our love with a kiss
Waitin' my whole life for this
Watching all my dreams come true
Lost in this moment with you

Lost in the moment, (in the moment) in this moment with you
Lost in the moment, yeah
Lost in the moment, (in the moment) in this moment with you
Lost in the moment''''''&''&''&''''''''
