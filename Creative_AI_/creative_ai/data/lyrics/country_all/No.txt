Looking back
At the dead ends and the detours
All I can do is long for a straighter line
Yeah, I was lost
I had no way of knowin'
Where the twists and turns were goin'
But sometimes you just gotta let the road wind

Could have been easier? Yeah.
A little smoother, right? Maybe so.
But lying here with you
Would I change one thing about that road?
No.

I believe
Things happen for a reason
Even though you might not see it at the time
Cause now I know
Every plan that came unraveled
Every crooked path I traveled in my life


Led me here to your side

Could it have been easier? Yeah.
A little smoother, right? Maybe so.
But lying here with you
Would I change one thing about that road?
No.

Yeah, I finally found you...

Could it have been easier? Yeah.
A little smoother, right? Maybe so.
But lying here with you
Would I change one thing bout that road?
It could have been easier, yeah
A little smoother right? maybe so
But lying here with you
Would I change one thing bout that road?
No.''''''''''''''''''
