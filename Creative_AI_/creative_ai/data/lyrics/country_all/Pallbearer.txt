He left me in the darkness all alone
She abandoned all the good times and the love I thought we had

I'm like a lonesome pallbearer walking down the aisle
Travelling to the graveyard, counting down the miles
With every earth-filled shovel, they dig that eternal bed
I'm like a lonesome pallbearer, carrying the dead
Carrying the dead

She don't call me and she don't try to
And my praying can't bring her back
My eyes are wide open, watching my future fade to black

I'm like a lonesome pallbearer walking down the aisle
Travelling to the graveyard, counting down the miles
With every earth-filled shovel, they dig that eternal bed
I'm like a lonesome pallbearer, carrying the dead
Carrying the dead

I've pondered trading places with the man laying in that hearse
I've tried to hold my head up but her leaving is like a curse

I'm like a lonesome pallbearer walking down the aisle
Travelling to the graveyard, counting down the miles
With every earth-filled shovel, they dig that eternal bed
I'm like a lonesome pallbearer, carrying the dead
Carrying the dead
Carrying the dead''''''''''''''''''
