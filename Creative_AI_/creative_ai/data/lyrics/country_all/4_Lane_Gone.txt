Been raining for 3 days
On the fast track to the highway
Trying to save a little time
Lord I never shoulda tried
Taking this backroad shortcut
Now I'm way stuck so sunk
I'll never catch her now
So I just put the tailgate down

She probably somewhere doing 95
I got nothing but this cooler and time
I cracked one waiting on a ride 2 or 3
Just to pass the time while she's headed to
A new town and I'm too lost too be found
She probably thinks that I don't care
Stuck in a rut in the middle of nowhere
And just my luck I'll be here all night long
Man I'm bummed out backroad buzzed
And she's 4 lane gone
Yeah she's 4 lane gone

Every empty beer can makes me miss her like hell
Man I could kick myself
For the place and the shape I'm in
Holding me back yeah, my wheels keep on spinning
And she's ticked off blacktop fast
I cracked one waiting on a ride 2 or 3
Just to pass the time while she's headed to
A new town and I'm too lost too be found
She probably thinks that I don't care
Stuck in a rut in the middle of nowhere
And just my luck I'll be here all night long
Man I'm bummed out backroad buzzed
And she's 4 lane gone
While I'm stuck here all alone
With a midnight natty light one more chance I've blown

I cracked one waiting on a ride 2 or 3
Just to pass the time while she's headed to
A new town and I'm too lost too be found
She probably thinks that I don't care
Stuck in a rut in the middle of nowhere
And just my luck I'll be here all night long
Man I'm bummed out backroad buzzed
And she's 4 lane gone
Yeah she's 4 lane gone
I'm out here all alone
Yeah she's 4 lane gone
She's 4 lane 4 lane gone
Yeah she's 4 lane gone
She's 4 lane gone''''''''''''''''''
