The corner cafe,
She scrapes some quarters off the table,
Says thanks yeah now maybe I'll be able,
To get that black Mercedes,
I've been saving for,
The other girls say,
You outta undue a couple buttons,
Start showing off a little something,
She says naw you go ahead,
Think I'd rather stay poor,
See I'm just making rent,
She said this ain't where my road ends

This may not be my town,
It'll do for now,
Till I can figure out,
Who I am,
Where I'm going,
She's slinging eggs and bacon,
With a college education
Just hanging out and waiting,
For a better plan,
She's ok not knowing,
She's young,
And the worlds wide open.

There's a rusty old ford,
Lives out back behind the diner,
Sitting there waiting on her to make her mind up,
It tends to sling a little gravel,
And take her who knows where,
Maybe head out west,
It's in Gods hands I guess.

She throws down that apron,
Takes the money she's been making,
Her life's out there waiting,
Got a better plan,
That's where she's going,
She's young,''''''''''''''''''
