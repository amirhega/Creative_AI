When your soul is weary and it seems you've lost your way
Jesus is calling, calling night and day
When you need a friend to go with you all the way 
Jesus is calling, calling night and day
Jesus is calling, calling night and day
And you will hear Him if you'll just pray
Calling for you (my brother) don't turn away (from Jesus)
Jesus is calling, calling night and day
If you're lost in sin. there's no need for you to stay
Jesus is calling, calling night and day
If the night is dark, you will soon see the day
Jesus is calling, calling night and day''''''''''''''''''
