In the great book of John - you're warned of the day
When you'll be laid - beneath the cold [clay
The Angel of Death - will come from the sky
And claim your poor soul - when the time comes to die.

When The Angel of Death - comes down after you
Can you smile and say - that you have been true
Can you truthfully say - with your dying breath
That you're ready to meet - the Angel of death.

When the lights all grow dim - and the dark shadows creep
And then your loved ones - are gathered to weep
Can you face them and say - with your dying breath
That you're ready to meet - the Angel of Death.

When The Angel of Death - comes down after you
Can you smile and say - that you have been true
Can you truthfully say - with your dying breath
That you're ready to meet - the Angel of death.''''''''''''''''''
