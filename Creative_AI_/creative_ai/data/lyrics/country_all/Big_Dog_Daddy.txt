Hey Daddy!
(Oh yeah)
Well I'm a big dog daddy you know my face and the joint starts a rockin' when I walk in the place
The band starts stompin' those rhythm guitars. And the dance floor's jumpin' to the back of the bar
Everybody looks better in the neon light
When a plan comes together on a Saturday night.

Yeah the parking lot's packed and that's a pretty good sign.
I take it right in the back I don't stand in line.
The boys all lookin' and a hittin' the spot
Sayin' the girls start shaking everything that they got
When a little cat momma gets a ready to ride.
I got Lincoln continental waitin' right outside.

I am a big dog daddy, Yeah a big dog daddy.
Boys stand back and the Girls are gettin' catty.
Somethin' goin' down with the big dog daddy.

You gotta stay out later if you're makin' the rounds cause there's are a lot of good joints on the way downtown.
I got some good buddies that can rock all night.

They ain't a looking for trouble but they know how to fight.

If your girl starts acting like she's one of a kind, ya grab the next one standin' at the head of line.

Big dog daddy, Just big dog daddy.
Got 'em all screaming from here to Cincinnati, it's hard to compete with the big dog a daddy.

A big dog daddy, Just big dog daddy.
Boys stand back and Girls are gettin' catty.
Somethin' goin' down with the big dog, big dog

Big dog daddy, just big dog daddy.
Boys stand back and Girls are gettin' catty.
Somethin' goin' down with the big dog daddy.

Got 'em all screaming from here to Cincinnati, try to compete with the big dog daddy.
Come on, boys...

Let's roll''''''''''''''''''
