I move through the big city, to make a little better money, then get back home.
Now here I am living in a little sub-division, surrounded by steal and stone.
I've got a neighbor, he's alone, his wife can be his dog, he don't know what to think of me.
'Cause signed my ball on a star of foam ball by a whole lot of eighteen grant.

'Cause I ain't out of the woods, yet, still got a blue collar and a red neck,
Got a gun right in the back window of my four wheel drive.
A country boy can survive.
I say, hey, y'all, in a reckon suit, with a massyo from head to toe
This cornfield corn bread country as a boy can get.
No, I ain't out, ain't out of the woods, yet.

Oh, I'm a little hell, baby

I've got a manicure lawn and a concrete palm where my mud is all locked to hang
We fire up the smoke and guess the pretty girl overcrack the hang, I'll let her shake that dang.
And when the moon starts rising and the spiders start to bite, all the neighbors is turning in.
We be blacking out the shine in this hell yeah time till the sun comes up again.

'Cause I ain't out of the woods, yet, still got a blue collar and a red neck,
Got a gun right in the back window of my four wheel drive.
A country boy can survive.
I say, hey, y'all, in a reckon suit, with a massyo from head to toe
This cornfield corn bread country as a boy can get
No, I ain't out, ain't out of the woods, yet
Country of the corn way, sweet tea all day, if you don't know what I mean.
I be sipping on some shine, put clothes on the line, eating corn bread and butter, babe

'Cause I ain't out of the woods, yet, still got a blue collar and a red neck,
Got a gun right in the back window of my four wheel drive
A country boy can survive.
I say, hey, y'all, in a reckon suit, with a massyo from head to toe
This cornfield corn bread country as a boy can get
No, I ain't out, ain't out of the woods, yet'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
