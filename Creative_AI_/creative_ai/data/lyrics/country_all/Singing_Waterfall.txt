There's a singin' waterfall
In the mountains far away
That's where I long to be
At the close of ev'ry day
That's where my sweetheart's sleepin'
Down beneath the clay
I often sit and wonder
Why the Lord took her away.

We'd meet there ev'ry ev'nin'
When the sun was sinkin' low
And we'd listen to the waters
As they rippled soft and low
And since she's gone to Heaven
I miss her most of all
Tonight my darlin's sleepin'
By the singin' waterfall.

Last night as I lay dreamin'
I heard my darlin' call
And then I went to meet her
By the singin' waterfall
She took me in her arms
Just like she used to do
And then I heard her whisper
We'll meet beyond the blue.

We'd meet there ev'ry ev'nin'
When the sun was sinkin' low
And we'd listen to the waters
As they rippled soft and low
And since she's gone to Heaven
I miss her most of all
Tonight my darlin's sleepin'
By the singin' waterfall.''''''''''''''''''
