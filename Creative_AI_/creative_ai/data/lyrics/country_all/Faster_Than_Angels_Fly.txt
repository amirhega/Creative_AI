A modern day Romeo and Juliet
American tragedy
Low rent, high rise lovers who met at the end of
Coronado Street
Crucifixes made in California gold
Two worlds bound to collide
Heaven can't help you if you go
Faster than angels fly

Well they burn the candle at both ends
As they danced into the flame
Making love and making plans
Driving Mother Mary insane
Strong as the beads of a rosary
Never too young to die
Some souls only know one speed
Faster than angels fly

Ghost-haunted barrio in Hollywood
Graffiti stained wailin' wall
Dead-end street gang up to no good
Out to make a retribution call
Sweet innocence caught in crossfire's fate
Too late to draw the line
Bullets can blow your dreams away
Faster than angels fly

They were still holding hands
When all hell broke loose
The both left this world
With more than most true lovers do

Strong as the beads of a rosary
Never too young to die
Some souls only know one speed
Faster than angels fly''''''&''&''&''&''''''
