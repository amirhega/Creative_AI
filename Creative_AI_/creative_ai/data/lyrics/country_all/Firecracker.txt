Yeah

When I look in her eyes
It ain't no surprise
Sparks start a flyin like the 4th of July

She gets me so hot, my heart starts a pumpin
When we get to kissin', there ain't no stoppin'

When it comes to love
She ain't no slacker
My little darlin' is a firecracker

When I light the fuse
I gotta get back quick
You gotta be careful with a dynamite stick

Son of a gun she fun to handle
And she packs a punch like a roman candle
She a pack of black cats in a red paper wrapper
My little darlin' is a firecracker

We might not ought to take a roll in the hay
'Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
Were a match made in heaven
And it ain't no joke.
But Id sure I hate to see it go up in smoke

We got a good thing going
And it feels so right
She's a firecracker
She's the light of my life.

She goes off with a great big BANG
Boys I tell ya it's a beautiful thing
She takes off you better hang on tight

She's a blonde bottle rocket
In the middle of the night

When she makes love she's a Heart attacker
My little darlin' is a Firecracker

Chrous:
We might not ought to take a roll in the hay
'Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
Were a match made in heaven
And it ain't no joke.
But Id sure I hate to see it go up in smoke

We got a good thing going
And it feels so right
She's a firecracker
She's the light of my life.

We got a good thing going
And it feels so right
She's a firecracker
She's the light of my life.We got a good thing going

And it feels so right
She's a firecracker
She's the light of my life.We got a good thing going

And it feels so right
She's a firecracker
She's the light of my life.
