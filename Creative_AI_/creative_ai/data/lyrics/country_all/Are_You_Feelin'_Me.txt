Sometimes I lie awake
Starin' at the ceilin'
I'll have someone beside me
She wont know your name
She wont be here long
Yeah she's almost a memory
You'll never be really gone
Girl are you feelin' me?

Do you fall asleep missin' my kiss in the dark
Wake up the next mornin
Not sure where you are
Is it killin' you, like it's killin' me
Are you lyin' there lyin' with somebody else
Tryin' to find the one thing I can't find for myself
When he's touchin you
Really touchin you,
Are you feelin' me?

You ever wish on a star that ain't fallin'
Hopin' your dreams will come true
Pray for the day that you know ain't comin'
Well I do
Baby I do
Baby I doooooooo
Baby I do!

Do you fall asleep missin' my kiss in the dark
Wake up the next mornin'
Not sure where you are
Is it killin' you, like it's killin' me
Are you lyin' there lyin' with somebody else
Tryin' to find the one thing I can't find for myself
When he's touchin' you
Really touchin' you,
Are you feelin' me?
Oh, when he's touchin u
Are you feelin' me?
Are you feelin' me?
Are you feelin' me?
Oh, are you feelin' me?
Girl are you feelin' me?'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
