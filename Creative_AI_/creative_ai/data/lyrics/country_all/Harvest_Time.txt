There's peanut dust and corn husks driftin' through the air tonight
The marchin' band's warmin' up under the football lights
There's tractor-trailers backed up down by the elevator
Train track grain car will roll in later
Get filled up and head on out in the world

It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon comin' up in the sky
Combine's cuttin' in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time

There's a thermos and a water jug rollin' around in the cab
A set of socket wrenches wrapped up in a greasy red rag
Bobby's mother pulls in the field bringin' us supper
We grab a bite and make sure to hug her
Saddle back up and let the big wheels roll

It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon comin' up in the sky
Combine's cuttin' in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time
At a quarter 'til 2 I kick off my boots in the laundry room
We'll start it all over tomorrow at noon
'Til it's all done until we're all done

It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon comin' up in the sky
Combine's cuttin' in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time''''&''''&''''&''''&''
