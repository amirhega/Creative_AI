"Oh step right up, ladies and gentlemen and see the big black rapping cowboy!"
"And take a peek at the original cowboy Stevie Wonder!"
"Oh, grab yourself a quarter and come see The World's Only Two-Foot Fred!"
"We've got free popcorn and balloons for the kids!"
"Come on down!"

Everybody's trying to get filthy rich off of somebody else's money

Grandma worked her whole life sewing at a shirt factory
She was saving for retirement, she had 'em take a little out every week
But then a big man up in a high rise; he cashed in his options and run
Well, took all her money and buddy that ain't funny
Now Granny's work will never be done
(bum, bum, bum)

'Cause, everybody's trying to get filthy rich off somebody else's money
Hey, me and my friends we were talking 'bout that, ole Freddy, Bill and Sonny
How with all my brains and all your cash, we could make a million, you can bet your ass
Everybody's trying to get filthy rich off of someone else's money

I saw a preacher on the TV with big diamond rings on his hand
He was begging for some money; he said to send us every penny you can
I guess the good Lord's got a mortgage and a payment on yacht in the Keys
So we better keep sending our hard earned living to those God fearing folks on TV

'Cause, everybody's trying to get filthy rich off somebody else's money
Hey, me and my friends we were talking 'bout that, ole Freddy, Bill and Sonny
How with all my brains and all your cash, we could make a million, you can bet your ass
Everybody's trying to get filthy rich off of someone else's money

"Oh, it's time for the sax"

Yeah with all my brains and all your cash, we could make a million, you can bet your ass
Everybody's trying to get filthy rich off of someone else's money
Everybody's trying to get "big and rich" off of someone else's money''''&'''&''&'''&''&'''''''
