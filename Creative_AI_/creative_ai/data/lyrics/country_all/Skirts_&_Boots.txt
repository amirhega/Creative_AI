Well, every Friday night in America
All the girls are getting all dressed up
Got the game on, talking on the cell phone
Polling out the pickup trucks

The boys are lined up for ladies night
They can't wait to get inside
They got one thing on their mind
Yeah

Skirts and boots looking so cute
Pat down front, what a honky-tonk move
All the pretty girls on the dance floor
Shaking them hips back and forth
Boys act crazy and the reason they do
Is skirts and boots, yeah, them skirts and boots

Now they're sitting at the bar shooting doubles down
Trying to get their courage up
Silver tongues smack talk, what you got, baby-doll?
Everybody's looking for love

Ricky took a right hook to the jaw
He looked at the wrong one a little too long
The reason for it all
Yes sir

Skirts and boots looking so cute
Pat down front, what a honky-tonk move
All the pretty girls on the dance floor
Shaking them hips back and forth
The boys act crazy and the reason they do
Is skirts and boots, yeah, them skirts and boots

Come on
It's the reason we pay a cover charge
Is laid every brick and every bar
Is the reason I play guitar
Whoo

Skirts and boots looking so cute
Pat down front, what a honky-tonk move
All the pretty girls on the dance floor
Shaking them hips back and forth
Boys act crazy and the reason they do
Is skirts and boots, yeah, them skirts and boots

Nice boots mama''&''&''&''&''&''&''&''&''&
