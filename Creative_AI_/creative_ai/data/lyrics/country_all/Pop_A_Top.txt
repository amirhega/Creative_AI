Pop a top again
I've just got time for one more round
Set 'em up, my friend
Then I'll be gone
And you can let some other fool sit down

I'd like for you'd to listen to
A joke I heard today
From a woman who
Said she was through, and calmly walked away
I tried to smile, and did a while
But it felt so outta place
Did you ever hear of a clown with tear
Drops streamin' down his face?

Pop a top again
I think I'll have another round
Set 'em up, my friend
Then I'll be gone
And you can let some other fool sit down

Home for me is misery
And here I'm wasting time
'Cause a row of fools on a row of stools
Is not what's on my mind
But then you see her leaving me
It's not what I prefer
So it's either here, just drinkin' beer
Or home rememberin' her

Pop a top again
I think I'll have another round
Set 'em up, my friend
Then I'll be gone
And you can let some other fool sit down
Pop a top again''''''''''''''''''
