All my life I've been tellin' myself
I don't need no no nobody else
I'm sittin' here thinkin'
Sittin' here drinkin' 'bout you

I looked through a mirror
And all that I see is one crazy lonely sucker lookin' back at me
I'm sittin' here thinkin'
Sittin' here drinkin' 'bout you

I'm just a man on a mission
Tryin' to make some decisions ahoooo
What am I gonna do?
'Cause I ain't goin' nowhere if I can't be somewhere with you
Boo boo boo

I'm sittin' here thinkin'
Sittin' here drinkin' 'bout you

Aw play it my brothers

Oh I'm just a man on a mission
Tryin' to make some decision ahoooo
What am I gonna do?
'Cause I ain't goin' nowhere if I can't be somewhere with you
Boo boo boo

I'm just sittin' here thinkin'
Sittin' here drinkin' 'bout you

Yes I'm sittin' here thinkin'
Sittin' here drinkin' 'bout you''''''''''&''''&&'''''&''''&&'''''''''''''''
