Hey y'all

Come on
Saddle up lets go
Laying it down like Mexico
Who needs a beach got a cold creek
Son you can bet ya it's the country Feista

Hey y'all Lets ride
Party going on on the riverside
Hey y'all jump in
Let your hair down go off the deep in
Cold beer hot things nothin' but a chicken wing
Dixie girls screaming with that southern draw
Hey Y'all

Cut off that's right
Suger so sweet the chickens won't bite
Whole lot of hay can't no who to stand
Raising our cups up sipping on some punch punch

Hey Y'all Lets ride
Party going on on the riverside

Hey y'all jump in
Let your hair down go off the deep in
Cold beer hot things nothin' but a chicken wing
Dixie girls screaming with that southern draw
Hey Y'all

Rope swing, Trout lines
Catfish, Cornbread, Cold Coors light
Bon Fires, Lawn chairs
Raise a lot of hell hell we just don't care

Hey Y'all Lets ride
Party going on on the riverside
Hey y'all jump in
Let your hair down go off the deep in
Cold beer hot things nothin' but a chicken wing
Dixie girls screaming with that southern draw
Hey Y'all
Hey Y'all
