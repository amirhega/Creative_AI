I'm a blue collar man had a hammer in my hand
For the last few years of my life
Working double overtime
While you sleep alone at night
Baby I know it's been a long hard ride
Sometimes I forget to say I love you
But baby please know that I do, Yeah

I live this life everyday
I make my share of mistakes
And every lesson I've learned
I've learned the hard way
I do the best that I can
And I hope you understand
After all, I'm just a man

I found a postcard that you've saved
That's turned yellow with age
Of a beautiful place in the sun
We've been saying every year that we're gonna go there
And run away just the two of us
Well I put that picture back on your dresser
Grab my keys, I got to get back to work, Yeah

I live this life everyday
I make my share of mistakes
And every lesson I've learned
I've learned the hard way
I do the best that I can
And I hope you understand
After all, I'm just a man

I live this life everyday
I make my share of mistakes
And every lesson I've learned
I've learned the hard way
I do the best that I can
And I hope you understand
After all, I'm just a man

After all, I'm just a man
That's all I am
Baby I'm just a man'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
