I'll bet you never heard ol' Marshall Dillon say
"Miss Kitty have you ever thought of runnin' away?
Or settlin' down, would you marry me
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please?"

She'd of said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot, his heart wasn't in it
He just stole a kiss, as he rode away
He never hung his hat up at Kitty's place

I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter
Ridin' my pony on the cattle drive
Stealin' the young girl's hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those camp fire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy

I might have had a side-kick with a funny name
Runnin' wild through the hills chasin' Jesse James
Or ending up on the brink of danger
Ridin' shot-gun for the Texas rangers

Go west young man, haven't you been told
California's full of whiskey, women and gold
Sleepin' all night, beneath the desert stars
With a dream in my eye, and a prayer in my heart

I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter
Ridin' my pony on the cattle drive
Stealin' the young girl's hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those camp fire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy

I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
I'd be wearin' my six-shooter
Ridin' my pony on the cattle drive
Stealin' the young girl's hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those camp fire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy
Yeah, I should've been a cowboy
I should've been a cowboy'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
