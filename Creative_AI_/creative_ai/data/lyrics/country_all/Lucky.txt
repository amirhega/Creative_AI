I'd rather be lucky than good.

Duggin' that lightning south pole, I've been on that power ball,
Raising my pick-up truck with a train.
Hooking it to a big bass, making me some of cool outcasts,
The way I'm living ain't hard to explain.

I'd rather be lucky than good,
Tough than pretty,
Rocky in the country than rolling in the city.
Spend my life rolling them dice,
Instead I'm living like everybody says I should.
I'd rather be lucky, rather be lucky than good.

Standing home last night, wonder on a red light,
Knowing when to go all in.
Coming up with the red light, picking up one that's so fine,
Ain't got no business talking to a teen.

I'd rather be lucky than good,
Tough than pretty,
Rocky in the country than rolling in the city.
Spend my life rolling them dice,
Instead I'm living like everybody says I should.
I'd rather be lucky, rather be lucky than good.

I'd rather be lucky than good,
Country than hood,
Any other day I'll bale in hay,
Fixing my truck, getting it stuck,
Covered in mud, ice cold bud.
Waiting that line, sipping that shine,
Eating fried chick and get tard picking.

Hey, do you like the way I'm cool for
Stop and got your stereo pumping.
Hey, do you like the way I'm cool for
Stop and got the girls.

I'd rather be lucky than good,
Tough than pretty,
Rocky in the country than rolling in the city.
Spend my life rolling them dice,
Instead I'm living like everybody says I should.
I'd rather be lucky, rather be lucky than good.

Hey, do you like the way I'm cool for
Stop and got your stereo pumping.
Hey, do you like the way I'm cool for
Stop and got the girls all jumping.''''''''''''''''''
