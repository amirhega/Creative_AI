In her pinstriped suit she's so sophisticated she can't help it her diploma got her makin' 200k while she's cruising in a jet black benz she can sip expensive wine and nibble cheese on a cracker in a pair of heels she climbs that corporate ladder but those go out the window but those go out the window on the weekend

That's when she drives barefeet likes to eat chicken with her fingers catch her down at wallys bar she's quiet the country singer she'll go cat fishing skinny dipping at the drop of a cowboy hat she ain't too good for that

In a Monday morning meeting she smokes the competition she's been known to dig an art exhibition Bethoven polo and now and then a good horse race she'll turn the nasdaq into cash like she's a magician knows politics better than a politician but she'd rather talk baseball anyday wanna play

That's when she drives barefeet likes to eat chicken with her fingers catch her down at wallys bar she's quiet the country singer she'll go cat fishing skinny dipping at the drop of a cowboy hat she ain't too good for that

She can say isn't or she can say ain't you can tell her she can but don't tell her she can't

That's when she drives barefeet likes to eat chicken with her fingers catch her down at wallys bar she's quiet the country singer she'll go cat fishing skinny dipping at the drop of a cowboy hat she ain't too good for that'''''&''''''&''''''&''''''''''
