First time saw her in them cut off jeans
I knew that I'd be in for a treat
Next thing I knew she had me tongue tied
She had me shaking from my head to my feet

Never should've underestimated her eyes
Smile over them long, long legs
Now she's got me down on my hands and knees
All I can do is beg

Haywire, she's got me going haywire, I'll never get tired
Never seen a woman do what she can do
Inspired, she's got my soul feeling inspired and full of desire
She's hotter than fire, she's got me going haywire, haywire

Every time we take a little ride in my truck
She likes the country turned way up
Do a little dancing on a long dirt road
She likes to show me the definition of love

Take a little dip in the river at night
Way out under the stars
Fresh air's good for a country girl
And that country girl is good for my heart

Haywire, she's got me going haywire, I'll never get tired
Never seen a woman do what she can do
Inspired, she's got my soul feeling inspired and full of desire
She's hotter than fire, she's got me going haywire, haywire

Haywire, she's got me going haywire, I'll never get tired
Never seen a woman do what she can do
Inspired, she's got my soul feeling inspired and full of desire
She's hotter than fire, she's got me going haywire, haywire

She's hotter than fire, she's got me going haywire

Haywire, haywire, haywire

Got me going, got me going, she's got me going haywire
Got me going, got me going, she's got me going haywire
Got me going, got me going, she's got me going haywire
Got me going, got me going, she's got me going haywire''''''''''''''''''
