Oh, know that I've come back and we've tried it over
But each time my dear it was worse than before
Now my heart is broke, it's sad and it's sore
So never again will I knock on your door

Oh, you know that I love you no other will do
Please tell me darlin', why can't you be true
But now you are gone, it's over and so
Never again will I knock on your door

Someday you'll be so lonely and blue
Then you will know just how much I loved you
But now you are gone, it's over and so
Never again will I knock on your door

Many a night I've cried over you
Hopin' and prayin' someday you'd be true
But now you are gone, it's over I know
So never again will I knock on your door

Oh, you know that I love you, no other will do
Please tell me darlin' why can't you be true
Now you are gone, it's over and so
Never again will I knock on your door''''''''''''''''''''
