It seems like yesterday we were bringing you home
I was so scared to hold you, now I'm scared to let go
Know that growin' up was just a part of your life
From baby to young lady, from woman to wife
Not everything I do seems to be wrong
Dear God, will you please let her hear my song
This road life leads could be so long
Lord I pray that she will always know her way home

She likes to ride in trucks
She don't need me around, near as much
I wish I could slow her down
But my baby's growin' up
And she likes to ride in trucks

Man it's funny how time flies when I look in her eyes
I used to see me, now I see him
As life [?] didn't know he'd became a man
And I realized that I used to be him
She used to run to me, now she's runnin' for the door
Chasin' my own dreams and doing my own thing
It's time for you to make your own mark in the world
But to me you'll always be daddy's little girl

Yes, she likes to ride in trucks
She don't need me around, near as much
I wish I could slow her down
But my baby's growin' up
She likes to ride in trucks

When he shook my hand and looked me in the eyes
He promised me that she'd be home on time
(Yeah he's a pretty good kid) Oh yeah
(But I was sixteen once)

She likes to ride in trucks
She don't need me around, near as much
I wish I could slow her down
But my baby's growin' up
She likes to ride in trucks
I wish I could slow her down
But my baby's growin' up
She likes to ride in trucks''''''''''''''''''
