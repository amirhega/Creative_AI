There's a wino in a garbage can
Looking for a bite
There's a lovely girl with lonely eyes
Needing love tonight
There's a junkie in a pallet
About to go insane
Yeah, there's more than one kind of hunger pain

There's a gambler out in Vegas
Preying for an ace
And a run-away from Cleveland
Longing for a place
Willard Scott says the crops
Are thirsty for some rain
Yeah, there's more than one kind of hunger pain

Tonight I feel so empty
In this big old lonely bed
With nothing but your memory
To keep my hunger fed
I'm aching for the whisper
Of your lips calling my name
Oh, it's crying shame

There's an old man in a nursing home
Who craves a human touch
There's a baby in an orphan home
That needs one just as much
There's a world of people starving
For a world of different things
Oh, there's more than one kind of hunger pain

God, I feel so empty
In this big old lonely bed
With nothing but your memory
To keep my hunger fed
I'm aching for the whisper
Of your lips calling my name
Oh, it's a crying shame
There's more than one kind of hunger pain
Yeah, there's more than one kind of hunger pain''''''''''''''''''
