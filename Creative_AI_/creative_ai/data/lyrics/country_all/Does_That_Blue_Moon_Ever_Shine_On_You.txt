Day by day, we let love just walk away
And I'll be the first to say, I was glad to see it go
And day by day, ever since you went away
I find that I'm still missin' you, I've just got to know

Does that blue moon ever shine on you
I want to hold you close to me, feel just like it used to be
And baby, if you feel like I do
You can come to me
Does that blue moon ever shine on you

On my mind, you were right there all the time
I could search and never find someone that does me like you do
Here's the part where I'm givin' you my heart
I was a fool to let you go, girl, I've just got to know

Does that blue moon ever shine on you
I want to hold you close to me, feel just like it used to be
And baby, if you feel like I do
You can come to me
Does that blue moon ever shine on you

Night after night, I look to the stars
Wonderin' where you might be
And I've thought to myself, is that very same moon
Shinin' on you like it's shinin' on me

Does that blue moon ever shine on you
I want to hold you close to me, feel just like it used to be
And baby, if you feel like I do
You can come to me
Does that blue moon ever shine on you''''''''''''''''
