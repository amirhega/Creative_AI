I used to think that I was living big
Bet my money on almost anything
Time and time, I got caught struggling
Oh, I had plans, I had dreams

And I had an open bar policy
Spending time tryin' to numb the pain
Lost my family just to gain a friend
Oh, strange faces I didn't need

I'm on a highway
Ain't going no place
Ain't got nowhere to run
I think this deal is done
Traveling goin' nowhere fast

My folks used to tell me
Turner stop and think
Don't waste your whole life
Doing selfish things

Hurting your loved ones
Just to get yourself a stir
There comes a time when
You gotta let it be

I thank the Lord
He had his hands on me
Not really thinking
I had sunken deep

I looked all around
And I was standing all alone
I had dug my myself a hole

I'm on a highway
Ain't going no place
Ain't got nowhere to run
I think this deal is done
Traveling goin' nowhere fast

And I looked around
And I was standing all alone
I had dug my myself a hole

I'm on a highway
Ain't going no place
Ain't got nowhere to run
I think this deal is done
Traveling goin' nowhere fast

I'm on a highway
A lonesome byway
You know, I don't know where to start
With changes on my heart
Traveling goin' nowhere fast
Traveling goin' nowhere fast
Traveling goin' nowhere fast''''''''''''''''''
