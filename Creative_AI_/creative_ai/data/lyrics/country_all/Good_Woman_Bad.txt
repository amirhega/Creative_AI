She was out last night till way past ten
Same thing all over again but with my best friend
Why'd she wanna make me so mad
I treat that woman good
Lord, I need a good woman bad

Now when I asked her to go to Sunday school
She went and called me a damned old fool
Now I don't understand
Why'd she wanna make me so sad
I treat that bad woman good
Lord I need a good woman bad

Here she comes
There she goes

Well I saved my money, and abought her a car
She got it stolen outside of the bar
She looks good, but she might not be
The kinda woman that I'm likely to need

Well, I don't know why I let her walk on me
She's impolite as she can be
Now I'm startin' to think
Hey, maybe I've been had

I treat that bad woman good
Lord, I need a good woman bad
(Repeat 3 times)
Yeah''''''''''''''''''
