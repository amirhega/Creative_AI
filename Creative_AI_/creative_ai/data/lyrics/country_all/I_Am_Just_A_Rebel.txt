I am just a rebel that's what I am
I can raise the devil with a five piece band
I got two fists of iron I got a heart of gold
I just have a hard time doin' what I'm told

Being a hillbilly don't get me down
I like it like that in fact you know it makes me proud
Yeah I'm American made by my ma and pa
Southern born by the grace of God
And I'm bound to be a rebel till they put me in the ground

I am just a rebel can't you see
Don't go looking for trouble it just finds me
When I'm a walking down the street people stop and stare
I know they're talking about me they say there goes that rebel there

And being a hillbilly don't get me down...
Oh yes I'm bound to be a rebel till they put me in the ground

Yeah yeah yeah I'm bound to be a rebel
Till they put me in the cold cold ground

I am just a rebel that's what I am
I am just a rebel can't you see yeah yeah
I am just a rebel''''''''''''''''''
