Yeah You can try to love your woman
Try to love your friends
Try to love your neighbor
You can try it again
Try to go to church
Try to live your life
Probably still be tryin' on the day that you die.

Well, if you're tryin' you ain't
(Tryin')
There's work to do son
You can't get up early
Baby, you can't get it done
Roll up your sleeves
Don't tell me that you can't
Make something something
If you're tryin' you ain't

Try something old
Try something new
Try it when no one else is even watchin' but you (watchin' but you)
Try just a little
Try it too much
Try an over do it and it still ain't enough

And, if you're tryin' you ain't
(Tryin' you ain't)
There's work to do son
You can't get up early
Baby, you can't get it done
Roll up your sleeves
Don't tell me that you can't
Make something something
If you're tryin' you ain't

Tryin'
Tryin' you ain't
Tryin'
Tryin'

Well if you're tryin' you ain't
(Tryin' you ain't)
There's work to do son
You can't get up early
Baby, you can't get it done
Roll up your sleeves
Don't tell me that you can't
Make something something
If you're tryin' you ain't
And, if you're tryin' you ain't
(Tryin' you ain't)
There's work to do son
You can't get up early
Baby, you can't get it done
Roll up your sleeves
Don't tell me that you can't
Make something something
If you're tryin' you ain't

Tryin'
Tryin'
Tryin' you ain't
