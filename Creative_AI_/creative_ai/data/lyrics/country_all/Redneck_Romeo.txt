He wears Old Spice, he got fuzzy dice
Hangin' from the rearview mirror of his 4 wheel drive
Yeah he's GQ, and he can do more
With cheap polyester than Calvin Klein
He drinks false staff, he got 27 ballcaps
He wears a different one every night
He'll tell you he's a lover
When he ain't pickin' a fight

He's a redneck romeo,
He thinks he's Elvis in a picture show
Silver chains but a heart of gold,
Lord you got to love his style.
A classic country Cassanova,
Thinks all the girls are crazy over him.
Everywhere that neon glows
You'll find a redneck romeo

He's got a hundred keys hangin' off his jeans
He knows they fit somethin' but he don't know what.
He's no cheap date, spend his whole paycheck
Buyin' drinks and playin' that jukebox.
Out on the floor he ain't no square,
He's a romancin' slow dancin' Fred Astaire
Dab of grill cream in his hair
Ladies stand in line.

He's a redneck romeo,
He thinks he's Elvis in a picture show
Silver chains but a heart of gold,
Lord you got to love his style.
A classic country Cassanova,
Thinks all the girls are crazy over him.
Everywhere that neon glows
You'll find a redneck romeo

He's in a class all by himself
Thinks there ain't nobody else like him
But everywhere that neon glows
You'll find a redneck romeo
Yeah he's a redneck romeo...

Ah I like that blue-font look
How did ya get it to stand that high?''''''''''''''''''
