She's sittin' by the water where the river gets wide,
Thinkin' 'bout swimming to the other side
Got a Marlboro red, and a can of cold Bud
Toes squished down in the Arkansas mud
Hey Mister! Yeah, I kissed her
Son, you ought to see her sister
Ya' gotta give a little something to a cold dog cat,
Finding him a woman who can shake like that

Hottie, she's a hottie; got a smokin' little body
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat
She's a-rockin' that cowboy hat
Hottie, she's a hottie; and just a little bit naughty
Ki yi diggy diggy, ki yi diggy diggy, yey hey hey hey hey

She's slidin' down the dam where the moss gets thick,
A-yellin' "Yee-haw!"
She's a redneck chick,
Spittin' in the fire, puttin' on a show, struttin' like a chicken to the radio,
Hey, Slick! She's a hick!
Mmm, in her buttermilk lipstick
Ya' gotta give a little something to a cold dog cat,
Finding him a woman who can shake like that

Hottie, she's a hottie; she got a smokin' little body
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat
She's a-rockin' that cowboy hat
Hottie, she's a Hottie; and just a little bit naughty
Singing ki yi diggy diggy, ki yi diggy diggy, yey hey hey hey hey

Dressed her up boys, I took her from the farm,
I brought her downtown, I hung her on my arm,
You've got to give a little somethin' to a cold dog cat,
Finding him a woman who can walk like that

Hottie, she's a hottie; she's got a smokin' little body
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat
She's rockin' that cowboy hat
Hottie, she's a hottie; and just a little bit naughty
Ki yi diggy diggy, ki yi diggy diggy, yey
Singing ki yi diggy diggy, ki yi diggy diggy
Yey hey hey hey hey

Singing ki yi diggy diggy, ki yi diggy diggy, Yey hey hey hey''''''''''''''''''''''''
