I got two shot glasses and a bottle of tequila with nothing but time on my hands.
I got my boots on tight and some money for the jukebox, so tell me if you're ready to dance.

I said hey good looking what's on your mind. Is there something I can help you find?
She said "I'm looking for a man for me and my kid."
I said honey he ain't here but a good time is.
She smiled and asked me if could show her one
I said take my hand darling let's start the fun.
I asked her name and she asked me mine
I said honey they call me Mr. Goodtime.

I got two shot glasses and a bottle of tequila with nothing but time on my hands.
