Oh! Please - don't let me love you
Just because I'm feelin' blue
And Please - don't let me kiss you
'Cause I know you'll be untrue.

Because you're sweet dear, I want to love you
Please - stay away from my heart
And please - don't let me love you
'Cause I know you'll break my heart.

Oh! Please - don't call me darlin'
When I know you don't love me
And Please - don't whisper sweetheart
For I know it just can't be

When I'm lonely, I want you only
Where is the dream I once knew
Oh! Please - don't let me love you
'Cause I know you'll be untrue.'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
