Too easy
Lord I can't sing, but I'm tryin'
To give my country folks somthin'they gon' like
But if you don't, well then I'm sorry
Meet me outback when I'm done and we can fight
I'm just here to do me the only way I know and I guarantee ya folks it's a hell of a show
See me and my boys are a rowdy bunch, yes ma'am I get drunk and throw the first punch
Old colts a ring leader, he ain't yelled at me
Been know to raise hell from la to tennessee, so don't get outta line 'cause we don't take no crap, we're just here to drink beer
And do some country rap,

Lord I can't sing, but I'm tryin'
To give my country folks somthin they gon' like
But if you don't, well then I'm sorry
Meet me outback when I'm done and we can fight
Y'all never thought that I can do it like this
It ain't country twang when I do my thing,
See I work from sun up to sun down,
You better be ready when I come to your town,
Cause me and my boys we gon' do it all night,
And we gon' party till we see the sunlight,

So fire up the grill, ice the beer, and tell your friends that they could meet us down the road where the blacktop ends,
Lord I can't sing, but I'm tryin'
To give my country folks somthin they gon' like
But if you don't, well then I'm sorry
Meet me out back when I'm done and we can fight
Well this here's the last verse, bout time to leave a redneck rap song I know its hard to believe, but I was raised on Conway
And Willie, Sugar Hill Gang, and Run DMC,
Told Sam what to think and it was bound to happen, bout time for someone to do some country rappin', giver the whole world a
Taste of Colt Ford, so pass the ammunition and praise the Lord
Lord I can't sing, but I'm tryin'
To give my country folks somthin' they gon' like
But if you don't, well then I'm sorry
Meet me out back when I'm done and we can fight
Lord I can't sing, but I'm tryin'
To give my country folks somthin'they gon'like
But if you don't, well then I'm sorry
Meet me out back when I'm done and we can fight!'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
