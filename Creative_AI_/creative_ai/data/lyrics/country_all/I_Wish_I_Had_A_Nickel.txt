They tell me little darlin',
That tomorrow you'll be wed,
You thought that you would hurt me,
But you hurt yourself instead,
I'll always be the same old pal,
Just as in years gone by,
I'll just set back and watch you,
While you set alone and cry.

Tears fallin' down your pretty cheeks,
Tears you cannot hide and tears you cannot keep,
They are tears of sorrow and tears of delight,
I wish I had a nickel, for every tear you shed last night.

I just dropped by to tell you that I wish you happi-ness,
I hope that you'll forgive me for in-truding like this,
I hope my dear your happiness will follow through the years,
I'll just set back and watch you, while you shed those bitter tears.

Tears fallin' down your pretty cheeks,
Tears you cannot hide and tears you cannot keep,
They are tears of sorrow and tears of delight,
I wish I had a nickel, for every tear you shed last night.''''''''''''''''''
