Dear Brother, Mama left us this morning
Death's angels took her away
She's gone to meet Daddy up there in heaven
But we'll meet again some day.

She left this world with a smile on her face
Whisp'ring the Saviour's name
Dear Brother, Mama left us this morning
For the city where is no pain.

As I stood by her bedside, those last few moments
I lived my childhood again
I thought of you Brother and of the old homestead
And my tears they fell like rain.''''''''''''''''''
