Place is packed, having a blast.
Take a sip, leave a tip, get to throwing them back.
Nothing but a few beers, on my mind.
Then the door swings open, I looked left.
You in that red dress, dagger through my chest.
There goes my good time

Where's a corner booth, when I need one?
A little spot I can hide, where the neon
Don't hit me, making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me.
All I want to find me is a waitress, to pour me up a shot of, forget this.
Damn night, and everything we've ever done.
Where's a corner booth when I need one?

It'd just make it worse, if you knew it hurt
And seen me sneaking out the backdoor now.
Looks like I'll be hanging around.
I try not to stare, or wonder if you care.
Hell, I don't even know if you know I'm here.
Or that I'm dodging you through the crowd.

Don't hit me, making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me.

Damn night, and everything we've ever done.
Where's a corner booth when I need one?

Maybe one in the back with the sear torn,
Where the smokes so thick you can't even see the dancefloor.
'Cause I know you're on the dance floor baby.

Damn night, and everything we've ever done.
I just wanna forget everything we done.
Where's a corner booth when I need one?
When I need one.''''''''''''''''
