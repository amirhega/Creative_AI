When we hear ol' Gabriel's trumpet blow
And we know the hand of God is surely nigh
My new hallelujah song I'll sing
Shouting praises to the King
I've got my one way ticket to the sky.

I've got my one way ticket to the sky
And happy, oh, happy am I
Walk with Jesus in the Holy Land
Shake my, my dad and mother's hand
I've got my one way ticket to the sky.

Soon the pearly gates will open wide
And the Saviour will lead us safe inside
God will wipe away our tears
No more sorrow no more fears
I've got my one way ticket to the sky.

I've got my one way ticket to the sky
And happy, oh, happy am I
Walk with Jesus in the Holy Land
Shake my, my dad and mother's hand
I've got my one way ticket to the sky.

There's a mansion waiting for me there
That my Savior has built for me on high
How the tears of joy now flow
As I gladly onward go
I've got my one way ticket to the sky.

I've got my one way ticket to the sky
Happy, oh, happy am I
Walk with Jesus in the Holy Land
Shake my, my dad and mother's hand
I've got my one way ticket to the sky...'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
