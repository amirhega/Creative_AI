Discount box wine
Burning like turpentine
Anything to get us buzzed
We got six strings, G strings
Pawn shop bling bling
Raisin' hell just because
Even old grannies getting chatty and batty
On pappy's apple pie moonshine
I don't know what you're expecting but buddy if you're bettin'
I'd be bettin' on a hell of a time

'Cause you know we're gonna party like cowboyz
Whoop out the big toys
Pour on the gasoline
Put some fire on the fuses
We're 'bout to do this
Pumped on adrenaline
We're getting jackety jacked up, beer backed and doubled up
Stand up and make some noise
We're gonna party like cowboyz

Some girls are gettin' flirty and some are dancing dirty
The country girls are coming alive
Some guys are rocking and some dudes are socking
And gonna have to take it outside
Two for ones are going, the pyro is blowing
The whole place is coming unwound
The roof is a raisin', the whole place is shakin'
And we're just getting started now

'Cause you know we're gonna party like cowboyz
Whoop out the big toys
Pour on the gasoline
Put some fire on the fuses
We're 'bout to do this
Pumped on adrenaline
We're getting jackety jacked up, beer backed and doubled up
Stand up and make some noise
We're gonna party like cowboyz

Feeling kinda Tonto riding on a pinto
Screaming cross the wide open range
Got fire for a saddle
Make the red dirt rattle
'Cause I'm riding on a trail of flames and she's a beautiful thing
She goes so fast, kick a jet plane's ass
And dang I love them footloosin' ways
Like a bull in a cage, make a cowboy rage
If I ever get to ride that hottie with a brain

Getting' jackety jacked up, beer backed and doubled up
Stand up and make some noise
Gonna party like cowboyz
Yeah we're gonna whoop out the big toys
Pour on the gasoline (gonna party like cowboyz)
Put some fire on the fuses
We're 'bout to do this
Pumped on adrenaline (gonna party like cowboyz)
Getting jackety jacked up, beer backed and doubled up
Come on and make some noise... (gonna party like cowboyz)
We're gonna party like cowboyz (I'm a cowboy baby)
I'm a cowboy''''&''&''&''&''&''''&''
