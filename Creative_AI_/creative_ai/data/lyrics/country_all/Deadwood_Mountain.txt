I've been a rambler all my life
Been a bet-it-all gambler
Yeah I let it all ride
Never been afraid of losing
There have been times I've lost it all
But it won't really matter
Someday when I'm gone

You can bury me on Deadwood Mountain
By my brother Wild Bill
And sister Calamity Jane
Don't bring me no flowers
Just a six gun smokin'
Put me eight feet down when you bury me
Put me eight feet down when you bury me

When your heart runs deeper
Than a ghost town gold mine
You just know you're bound to find
That mother lode
You'll spend your last heart beat
Chasing after rainbows
No there's no place you won't go
To win one more time

You can bury me on Deadwood Mountain
By my brother Wild Bill
And sister Calamity Jane
Don't bring me no flowers
Just a six gun smokin'
Put me eight feet down when you bury me
Put me eight feet down when you bury me

And cover me
A little extra deep
Cause that's the only way
I'm ever gonna rest in peace

You can bury me on Deadwood Mountain
By my brother Wild Bill
And sister Calamity Jane
Don't bring me no flowers
Just a six gun smokin'
Put me eight feet down when you bury me
Put me eight feet down when you bury me
Whoa, put me eight feet down when you bury me''''''&''&&'''&''&&'''''''
