It's hard to describe
You're like nothin', I've ever known in my life
Kindness flowin', from down deep inside your eyes
So selfless and complete

And beauty in and out
All around you, not a single cloud
Like the rain just stops, before it, hits the ground
And puddles, at your feet

You're an angel
I know heaven wonders where you are
Like you fell off some old shinin' star
Right into my heart

An angel
When I'm with you I feel like a king
Just like out of some old movie scene
An angel, everything but the wings

Lookin' at you
It's hard to believe that you could feel the way I do
Never thought I'd find so much love to fall into
Or perfect or true

So never go away
If heaven calls you back just ask if you can stay
I'll never find someone to ever take your place
You know they only made a few

'Cause you're an angel
I know heaven wonders where you are
Like you fell of some old shinin' star
Right into my heart

An angel
When I'm with you I feel like a king
Just like out of some old movie scene
An angel, everything but the wings

Everything but the wings
An angel, everything but the wings''''''''''''''''''''''''
