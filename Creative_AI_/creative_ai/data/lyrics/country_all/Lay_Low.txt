I wanna drive until my cell phone
Runs out of range and every bar is gone
Cut through the woods another hundred miles
And disappear for a while

I wanna hear raindrops fallin' down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my travelin' boots
See your silhouette in that firelight
Feel your body lyin' next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low

I wanna end up nowhere on a map
A little cabin sittin' so far back
Out in the country
Just the moon and stars
Are gonna know where we are

I wanna hear raindrops fallin' down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my travelin' boots
See your silhouette in that firelight
Feel your body lyin' next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low

Just lay low, slow it down
Girl, let's go and get outta town
I wanna hear raindrops fallin' down

I wanna hear raindrops fallin' down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my travelin' boots
See your silhouette in that firelight
Feel your body lyin' next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low

Just lay low''''''''''''''''''
