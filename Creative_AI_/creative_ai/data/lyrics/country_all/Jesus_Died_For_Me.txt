When everything goes wrong
And it seems all hope is gone
I remember how my Savior died
He died there on the cross
So this world would not be lost
Jesus died for me long ago

Jesus died for me long ago
On a hillside far away
He was tortured and slain
God bless His Holy name

Jesus died for me long ago
What pain He suffered there
The Holy One so dear
So that you and I could live
I'll try to repay
For His sufferin' on that day
Jesus died for me long ago

Jesus died for me long ago
On a hillside far away
He was tortured and slain
God bless His Holy name

As He hung there all alone
His life's blood almost gone
He never stopped prayin' for me
So I'll follow all the way
And live with Him someday
Jesus died for me long ago

Jesus died for me long ago
On a hillside far away
He was tortured and slain
God bless His Holy name''''''''''''''''''
