You're like a screen flashing insufficient funds.
Cops knocking when the party's just begun.
You're a big rain cloud parked over my boat.
You're a cell phone splashing in my coffee cup.
A fumble on the one when my team was going up.
You're like brakes on my brain and all I know

You're a buzzkill every time you come around.
Those beers might as well have been poured out.
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what that's not what's gonna be?
You walk right by crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill. Baby, you're a buzzkill.

I used to do everything I could do to do nice things.
No matter what I did or didn't do it didn't change.
Everybody knows you ended us.
So, while you're showing up here on my side of the tracks
Slipping in this barn just to check out where I'm at.
I was a six pack in. Now I'm sober as a judge.

'Cause you're a buzzkill every time you come around.
Those beers might as well have been poured out.
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what that's not what's gonna be?
You walk right by crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill.

'Cause if it didn't hurt enough now I got to see you flirt
Nailed to the stool, watching you work.
Don't you give a damn about how I feel
You little brown haired, blue eyed, beautiful buzzkill
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're such buzzkill.

Yeah, you're a buzzkill every time you come around.
Those beers might as well have been poured out.
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what that's not what's gonna be?
You walk right by crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill. You little buzzkill.''''''''''''''''''
