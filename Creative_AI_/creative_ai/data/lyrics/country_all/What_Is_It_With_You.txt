Girl, there ain't no way you don't know how pretty you are
Every mirror in this two lane town knows the trouble you cause
I'd give anything to take that beer back I sent your way
I shoulda just took a shot of warm whiskey and called it a day

Girl, you make me wanna love, you make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase or just something you do
What is it with you
Are we in, are we out, why you runnin' me around
Why you havin' such a damn hard time, girl, with the truth
What is it with you

I spent half the day all hungover the morning after your kiss
I knew the second that you showed up, baby, it'd be another week of this
I keep prayin' that you mighta left something
Something when you get undressed
Something that you wanna come back for
Whatever you can do to get me back in your mess

Girl, you make me wanna love, you make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase or just something you do
What is it with you
Are we in, are we out, why you runnin' me around
Why you havin' such a damn hard time, girl, with the truth
What is it with you

Oh, I ain't me, I ain't right
But I'll admit I kinda like all the heaven and hell that you put me through
What is it with you
Girl, you make me wanna love, you make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase or just something you do
What is it with you

What is it with you
Oh, what is it with you''''''''''''''''''
