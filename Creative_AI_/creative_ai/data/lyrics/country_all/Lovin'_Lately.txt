Out with my friends and here it goes again
Somebody asks me where you're at
I don't know what to say, I've tried you everyday
It's been so long since you've called
I'll bet your having a real good time,
But I hate to think of what you're doing tonight,
And who you're holding close I don't really wanna know

Who you've been lovin' lately
Who you've been callin' baby
Who you've been runnin' around in this tell all town
I guess you've finally got the best of me
I guess you thought I'd never see
You know it's so hard to believe how we came down
Like we were nothin' baby, who you been lovin' lately?

I thought that I could trust the way we made love
You made me feel it was something real
Now everything you've said is lying in our bed
Like shattered glass against my back
The way you got me just blows my mind
Didn't care enough to even say goodbye
I'd give anything now if I could stop thinking about

Who you've been lovin' lately
Who you've been callin' baby
Who you've been runnin' around in this tell all town
I guess you've finally got the best of me
I guess you thought I'd never see
You know it's so hard to believe how we came down
Like we were nothin' baby, who you been lovin' lately?

Yeah who you been lovin' lately

I don't wanna know, but I've gotta know
I don't wanna know, I've gotta know
I don't wanna know, but I've gotta know
I don't wanna know, I've gotta know

Who you've been lovin' lately
Who you've been callin' baby
Who you've been runnin' around in this tell all town
I guess you've finally got the best of me
I guess you thought I'd never see
You know it's so hard to believe how we came down
Like we were nothin' baby, who you been lovin' lately?
Like we were nothin' baby, who you been lovin' lately?'''''&'''&'''&'''&'''''''''&'''&'
