I used to spend every night
Chasin' whiskey and skirts and neon lights
(Short skirts)

I stumble in, eyes bloodshot red
And the sun comin' up and mama shakin' her head
(Sorry mama)

But every boy's gotta grow up and be a man some day
Oh and it took a while but I finally changed my ways
So now

I only do it every chance I get
It ain't a habit, I got a handle on it
It ain't an all day, everyday thang
Unless I think I can

Used to be mornin', noon and night
Now I couldn't stop it and I ain't lyin'
I slowed down so much, you could say I quit
'Cause now I only do it every chance I get

Well, the first time I laid eyes on you
I knew my wilder days were through
So long

And after that first time behind closed doors
I didn't wanna run with the boys no more
(I really want more)

Your kinda love makes a man wanna stay at home
But I had to finally find some self control
So now

I only do it every chance I get
It ain't a habit, I got a handle on it
It ain't an all day, everyday thang
Unless you want to, baby

Used to be mornin', noon and night
Now I couldn't stop it and I ain't lyin'
I slowed down so much, you could say I quit
'Cause now I only do it every chance I get

I only do it every chance I get
It ain't a habit, I got a handle on it
It ain't an all day, everyday thang
Unless I've got the time

It used to be mornin', noon and night
Now I couldn't stop it and I ain't lyin'
I slowed down so much, you could say I quit
'Cause now I only do it every chance I get

Every chance I get
(Every chance I get)
Come on''''''''''''''''''
