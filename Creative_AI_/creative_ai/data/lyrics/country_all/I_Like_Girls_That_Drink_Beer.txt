Bye bye baby I'm leaving
You can keep your mansion and your money
Your boat and your Benz and your uptown friends
And your country club that ain't really country
I need a little down home lovin'
And a man ain't gonna get it up here
Yeah I'll find what I want in a honky tonk
I like girls that drink beer

You bought me a black tie suit and I ain't wearin' it
Can't be seen in that thing in my Lariat
Ain't goin' down to the ball in your chariot
This high rise life just ain't for me

Bye bye baby I'm leaving
Now you can keep your mansion and your money
Your boat and your Benz and your uptown friends
And your country club that ain't really country
I need a little down home lovin'
And a man ain't gonna get it up here
Hey I'll find what I want in a honky tonk
I like girls that drink beer

There's a two lane black tap road and I'ma hittin' it
Skynard back song, let her fly just a-gettin' it
Find me a little hot spot and just sit in it
Give me a mug of that ice cold brew
Get me a girl that's got one too

Bye bye baby I'm leaving
You can keep your mansion and your money
Your boat and your Benz and your uptown friends
And your country club that ain't really country
I need a little down home lovin'
And a man ain't gonna get it up here
Hey I'll find what I want in a honky tonk
I like girls that drink beer

Hey I need a little down home lovin'
And a man ain't gonna get it up here
Hey I'll find what I want in a honky tonk
I like girls that drink beer
Yeah I'll find what I want in a honky tonk
I like girls that drink beer''''''''''''''''''
