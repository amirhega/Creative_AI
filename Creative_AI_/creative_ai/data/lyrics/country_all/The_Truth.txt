Tell 'em all I'm on vacation,
Say I went to visit friends,
That you ain't heard or seen from me in quite a while,
When they ask you where I've been,
Tell 'em I'm out on the west coast where it don't ever rain,
And that I'm probably doing fine,

Just don't tell 'em I've gone crazy,
That I'm still strung out over you,
Tell 'em anything you want to,
Just don't tell 'em all the truth,
Yeah don't tell 'em all the truth,

Tell 'em all I'm out in Vegas,
Blowin' every dollar I ever made,
Tell 'em that I must be into something bad for me cause,
I sure lost a lot of weight,
Tell 'em I'm out on the road with some old rock and roll band,
Living like a gypsy can,

The truth is that I'm asking you to lie,
And we both know that it ain't right,
But if you ever loved me please,
Have some mercy on me,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

Tell 'em anything you want to,
Just don't tell 'em all the truth,
Yeah don't tell 'em all the truth,
I still need you,
Yeah that's the truth,
I still love you,
Baby that's the truth.''''''''''''''''
