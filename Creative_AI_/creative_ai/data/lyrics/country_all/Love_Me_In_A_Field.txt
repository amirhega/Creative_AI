Don't need a hotel or a high rise
A big old bunk bed a fancy name
I don't need a backseat, don't need no rusty truck
We could leave that dust on that old porch swing

Let's get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our T-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out on the grass bring your blanket in the beach
Tear up some turnip rings or find some up on a hill
Baby love me in a field

Now we got that California king
In the back of that Georgia double wire
And I'm about to bust out the seams
When I get you to the country side
What's that sound like to you?
'Cause it sounds dang good to me
Just hit me with a smile when you're ready to leave

Let's get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our T-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out on the grass bring your blanket in the beach
Tear up some turnip rings or find some up on a hill
Baby love me in a field

Find an old pasture
Where the cows ain't
Been for a while
Wanna see your blue eyes
Where the flowers go wild
Little after midnight
Morning dew
On our skin

I'm sure that nobody, nobody know where we've been.

Let's get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our T-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out on the grass bring your blanket in the beach
Tear up some turnip rings or find some up on a hill
Baby love me in a field'''''''''''''''''''''''
