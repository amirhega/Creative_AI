My brakes are on fire from tryin' to slow down
I'm always burnin my tires and my horn is too loud
I catch people starin', looking funny at me
When I step to the window and I toss a TV

Sometimes I get crazy and it makes a big scene
But when I hit 21, I wanna stand up and scream
I'm filthy rich with laughter, I'm too big for the room
You know from two stories up, a Zenith makes a big boom

It's hard to get around in a six foot town
When you're ten feet tall, everything is so small
I'm always bumpin my head, I'm way too long for the bed
Yeah, it's hard to get around in a six foot town

Some people live inside a tiny little box
They're preoccupied about mismatching their socks
I've never been one to worry bout much
I just wanna laugh and love, I just wanna live it up

But it's hard to get around in a six foot town
When you're ten feet tall, everything is so small
I'm always bumpin my head, I'm way too long for the bed
Yeah, it's hard to get around in a six foot town

Sometimes I stumble just because of my size
But hey y'all that's all right
That's the way God made me, I am what I am
And I can't do nothin' bout that

Oh, but it's hard to get around in a six foot town
When you're ten feet tall, everything is so small
I'm always bumpin my head, I'm way too long for the bed
Yeah, it's hard to get around in a six foot town

It's hard to get around in a six foot town
When you're ten feet tall, everything is so small
I'm always bumpin my head, I'm way too long for the bed
Yeah, it's hard to get around in a six foot town''''''&''&&'''&''&&'''''''
