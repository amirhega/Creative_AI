I put myself on a limb
And I feel it giving way from the weight of the rain
If I brake or I bend
I get myself together again, put my face to the wind

It might be a long, long way to my golden day
That's a chance I'm willing to take
There's no chain, no cage that I won't brake
In this long, long leap of faith
I close my eyes
And I walk right to the edge, throw my hand up to the sky
Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to live this life through my dreaming eyes

TO a rocket I've been tied, I'm ready for the screaming ride
It's full of fuel and I just lit the fuse
I'm a raging burning ring of fire and I get hotter as I get higher
And I'm tearing a hole right through this sky of blue
Oh, There's no chain no cage that I won't break
In this long, long leap of faith
To a rocket I've been tied, I'm ready for the screaming ride
It's full of fuel and I just lit the fuse
I'm a raging burning ring of fire and I get hotter as I get higher
And I'm tearing a hole right through this sky of blue
I'm a raging burning ring of fire and I get hotter as I get higher
And I'm tearing a hole right through this sky of blue
I'm a raging burning ring of fire and I get hotter as I get higher
And I'm tearing a hole right through this sky of blue
In this long, long leap of faith.''''&'''&''&'''&''&'''''''
