I can twist the top off a 12-pack of longnecks
Get my redneck on baby all night long with the boys
And never even think about you
I can be sittin' with someone new at a table for two
Buzzin' on a bottle of wine and your memory
Ain't messin' up my good time

But when I get whiskey'd up, that wantin' you again
Starts kickin' back in and I'm late night calling you up
My heart starts hurtin' when that bourbon starts burning
And I can't help but touch that stuff
It's just like you all warm and smooth
Even though I know that you don't miss me
It's like you're here with me
When I get whiskey'd up

Every sip I take I can taste your kiss
I feel the fire of your fingertips on my skin
I guess that's why every now and then

I get whiskey'd up, that wantin' you again
Starts kickin' back in and I'm late night calling you up
My heart starts hurtin' when that bourbon starts burning
And I can't help but touch that stuff
It's just like you all warm and smooth
Even though I know that you don't miss me
It's like you're here with me
When I get whiskey'd up

It's a straight shot back to me and you
Yeah when I pour one up
I know just what I'm getting into

When I get whiskey'd up, that wantin' you again
Starts kickin' back in and I'm late night calling you up
My heart starts hurtin' when that bourbon starts burning
And I can't help but touch that stuff
It's just like you all warm and smooth
Even though I know that you don't miss me
It's like you're here with me
When I get whiskey'd up
When I'm all whiskey'd up''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
