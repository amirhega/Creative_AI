Any minute the five o'clock crowd will be coming
Taps will be flowing with beer
The cigarette smoke soon to be rising
And at 5:30 Clancy gets here

She knows all their faces
She's practically raised them
And that's why they're loyal and true
They'll pay their tabs
And that pays the light bill
And she keeps a glass full of brew

And the welders and the drivers
And the old nine to fivers
And the regular Joes of the world
Are singing, here's to you, Clancy
And your neighborhood tavern
Pour me another, my girl

There's a waitress named Lilly
Shows up at 7
To make sure the service is great
And there's a black dude named Elmo
That cooks in the kitchen
Burgers and chicken fried steak

Here round 9 o'clock the band will start playing
And the music will fill up the air
And they'll take a break every 45 minutes
And the jukebox takes over from there

And the welders and the drivers
And the old nine to fivers
And the regular Joes of the world
Are singing, here's to you, Clancy
And your neighborhood tavern
Pour me another, my girl

It's 1:35 last call's upon us
It's time to settle a score
Won't you call me a cab and bring me a tab
And while you're at it bring me one more

She's cleaned the last table
And shined up the bar
It's late and everyone's gone
Then she'll cock her pistol
And count all her money
And drive that old Chrysler back home

And the welders and the drivers
And the old nine to fivers
And the regular Joe's of the world
Singing, here's to you, Clancy
And your neighborhood tavern
Pour me another, my girl

Have a good night sleep, Clancy
In your neighborhood tavern
We'll see you tomorrow, my girl''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
