I was sinking deep in sin,
Far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within,
Sinking to rise no more,
But the Master of the sea,
Heard my despairing cry,
From the waters lifted me,
Now safe am I.

Love lifted me Love lifted me
When nothing else could help
Love lifted me
Love lifted me Love lifted me
When nothing else could help
Love lifted me

All my heart to Him I give,
Ever to Him I'll cling
In His blessed presence live,
Ever His praises sing,
Love so mighty and so true,
Merits my soul's best songs,
Faithful, loving service too, to Him belongs.

Love lifted me Love lifted me
When nothing else could help
Love lifted me
Love lifted me Love lifted me
When nothing else could help
Love lifted me

Love lifted me Love lifted me
When nothing else could help
Love lifted me
Love lifted me Love lifted me
When nothing else could help
Love lifted me''''''''''''''''''
