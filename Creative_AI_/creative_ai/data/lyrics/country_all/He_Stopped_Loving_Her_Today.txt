He said, "I'll love you 'til I die"
She told him, "You'll forget in time"
And as the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind

He kept her picture on his wall
Went half-crazy, now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hopin' she'd come back again

Kept her letters by his bed
Dated nineteen sixty-two
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'

I went to see him just today
Oh, but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

She came to see him one last time
We all wondered if she would
It kept runnin' through my mind
This time, he's over her for good

An' he stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped lovin' her today''''''''''''''''''''
