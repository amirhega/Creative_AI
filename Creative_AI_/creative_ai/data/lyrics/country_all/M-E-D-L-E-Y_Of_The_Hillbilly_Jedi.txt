In my pocket, my pocket, my pocket
I've got a little rocket, a rocket, a rocket
I took it and I lit it, I lit it, I lit it
And now I'm gonna fly it to the moon

In my pocket, my pocket, my pocket
I've got a little rocket, a rocket, a rocket
I took it and I lit it, I lit it, I lit it
And now I'm gonna fly it to the moon with you

And if you've got a candy machine
Won't you make something sweet and good like they do out in Hollywood
Or maybe we could rent a penthouse suite
Don't matter if we got no money
It don't cost nothing to dream

I never told you I could walk on water (walk on water) but if you've got a quarter friends you know I'll give it a try
And if you want to, you can take my hand (you can take my hand)
Yeah I bet you can
See you can walk on water with me

I ain't never gonna be afraid to say what I want to say even if it sounds a little crazy
Doobily diddy, Doobily diddy, if I had a nickel every time I tried to tell you that I really wish that you'd be my gal
Then we'd be rolling in the money honey on a beach and it's so sunny while somebody's serving us Champagne
I know it sounds a bit insane but I'm a little bit crazy for your love baby
For your love baby
You've got the sweetest thing but I'm not sure what it is
I know I likes a lot of it every day
I likes that

Doobily diddy, Doobily diddy, if I had a nickel every time I tried to tell you that I really wish that you'd be my gal

I know it sounds a bit insaannnnnnne

Let's don't say goodbye
When we leave tonight
Let's just make a toast to all the good times and let's start making plans right now for another big go round
Say see ya later gator but let's don't say goodbye
Don't you know say see ya later gator, let's don't say goodbye''''&''&''&''&''&''''&''
