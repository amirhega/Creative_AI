I toss and turn, I'm losing sleep
Can't seem to make any sense of anything
I keep wandering around in circles, in a daze
Just when I start awakening
I find that something's intoxicating me
Till I'm tangled up, lost inside a maze

I can't outrun it
Just keeps comin'
Girl, your love is relentless

Just like the waves against the sand
Over and over and time and time again
Your love keeps on reaching out to me

I can't outrun it
Just keeps comin'
Girl, your love is relentless
I can't fight it
There's no hiding
Girl, your love is relentless

I'm staring at a hurricane
A hundred miles of driving rain
I just smile and lean into the wind
'Cause I can't outrun it

I can't outrun it
Just keeps comin'
Girl, your love is relentless
I can't fight it
There's no hiding
Girl, your love is relentless

I toss and turn, I'm losing sleep
Can't seem to make any sense of anything
I keep wandering around in circles, in a daze
Just when I start awakening
I find that something's intoxicating me
Till I'm tangled up, lost inside a maze''''''''''''''''''
