I usually tell you take your time
Go 45, ease in your drive
I put it in park, come inside
While you get ready
We lay it back, we take it slow
We put the night on cruise control
Whatcha wanna do, where you wanna go
I don't care baby
Been fixin' fence, been runnin' roads
Missing you like crazy
Girl, when I come to town tonight
I'm comin' in hot

Already got your song on
When you climb in it'll be playin'
Been thinking 'bout you all week long
Oh baby don't keep me waiting
You've got about 45 minutes tops
'Fore I roll in there ready to rock
Comin' to get some of what you got
Girl I'm comin' in hot
I'm comin' in hot

Girl I already stopped by the store
Can in a koozie sittin' in your door
Cooler in the back if you want some more
No, I ain't playin'
You'll love the spot that I picked out
Where the stars and the moon come shining down
Won't be anybody else around, look out
I'm comin' in hot

Already got your song on
When you climb in it'll be playin'
Been thinking 'bout you all week long
Oh baby don't keep me waiting
You've got about 45 minutes tops
'Fore I roll in there ready to rock
Comin' to get some of what you got
Girl I'm comin' in hot
I'm comin' in hot

Like a summer black top
Like a 30 ought shot
Like I'm runnin' from the cops
To get to you girl
Like these 35 tires
Just caught on fire
Baby ready or not
I'm comin' in hot

Already got your song on
When you climb in it'll be playin'
Been thinking 'bout you all week long
Oh baby don't keep me waiting
You've got about 45 minutes tops
'Fore I roll in there ready to rock
Comin' to get some of what you got
Girl I'm comin' in hot
I'm comin' in hot
I'm comin' in hot
Yeah I'm comin' in hot''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
