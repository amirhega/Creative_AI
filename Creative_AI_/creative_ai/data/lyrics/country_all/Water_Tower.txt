State champs white and blue
Yeah, I remember you
You sure had a hell of a view from way up there
High above the yellow pines
And first baptist "Jesus Saves" sign
I talked to you a million times but
I'm getting out of hand

Water tower, it sure is good to see you,
I've been away, for way too long
Water tower like a lighthouse in a storm,
You help me find my way back home

How far did you think I'd get
When I pointed my wheels out west?
A little young and dumb I guess
Gotta learn somehow
Slowin' down and drivin' in
I can finally breathe again
It's like I found a long lost friend
God I've missed this town

Water tower, it sure is good to see you,
I've been away, way too long
Water tower like a lighthouse in a storm,
You help me find my way back home

You and that lonesome full moon watching over me
I'm right where I'm supposed to be

Water tower, it sure is good to see you,
I've been away, way too long
Water tower like a lighthouse in a storm,
You help me find my way back home
You help me find my way''''''''''''''''''
