I hated like the devil
To tell her we were through
I was sure it would break her heart
Tear her world in two

She is such a fragile thing
Lord, I hate to make her cry
So I broke it to her gently
When I told her goodbye

She cussed me like a sailor
Kicked a hole through the kitchen wall
She threw a fit and threw the phone
Half-way down the hall

She said"I'll be down at the bar"
Then I heard the front door slam
I guess all in all
She took it like a man

I was thinking she'd reach out to me
And beg me not to go
Or run straight to her momma's
'Cause I'd hurt her so

Thought she'd be devastated
I had a tender moment plan
I didn't think that she could take it
But she took it like a man''''''''''''''''''
