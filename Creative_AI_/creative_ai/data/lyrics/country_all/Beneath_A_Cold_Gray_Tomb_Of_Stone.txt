Passing by a lonesome graveyard
Everything I love is gone
Weeping as they lay my darling
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

In this world I'm left to wander
With no one to call my own
While my precious darling's sleeping
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

Out there in that lonesome graveyard
She is sleeping all alone
And I buried my heart with her
Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

Skies above are dark and stormy
All the sunshine, all is gone
For the while my love is sleeping
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

My heart is dead and yet I'm living
Traveling through this world alone
I wish that I was with my darling
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone''''''''''''''''''
