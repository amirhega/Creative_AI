I need to hear a melody
The sad with three part harmony
A bar room jukebox symphony
I need to hear a melody

I need to hear a song that's blue 
Enough to break a heart in two
After what you put me through
I need to hear a song that's blue

Yeah make it lonely
When you do it
I'll know somebody else
Have just been through it
Instead of hurting by myself
Man I'll just sing along
I need to hear a loser crying
Songs about a love that's dying
Lyin' cheatin' to the bone
Three chord stone cold country song

I need to hear a drinking tune
With cowboys howling at the moon
And some swinging lonesome moon
I need to hear a drinking tune

Yeah make it lonely
When you do it
I'll know somebody else
Have just been through it
Instead of hurting by myself
Man I'll just sing along
I need to hear a loser crying
Songs about a love that's dying
Lyin' cheatin' to the bone
Three chord stone cold country song
Yeah country song
Three chord stone cold country song'''''''''''''''''''''
