I've been here a bunch of times
It all starts with the same ol lines it's over baby it's over
Nothing 'bout it ever feels good
It knocks you down just like it should
But it goes away it always goes away
Something about this time feels different
It's like I'm in a fight I'm about to lose

This might be the heartache that don't stop hurting
It just keeps working on me
It just keeps picking on me
And these might be the tears that keep on falling
They wont stop coming on down
They wont stop raining on down
And baby its to early to know for certain
But this might be the heartache that don't stop hurting

Man I've tried to kill the pain by shooting whiskey through my brain
But it never works it only makes it worse
So tonight I'm here again throwing punches in the wind
At some enemy that I can't even see

I know that I don't want it let it have me
But every time it hits I feel the truth

This might be the heartache that don't stop hurting
It just keeps working on me
It just keeps picking on me
And these might be the tears that keep on falling
They wont stop coming on down
They wont stop raining on down
And baby its to early to know for certain
But this might be the heartache that don't stop hurting

Tomorrow ill stand up again
And give it my best shot again
But tonight it sure feels like

These might be the tears that keep on falling
They wont stop coming on down
They wont stop raining on down
And baby its to early to know for certain
But this might be the heartache that don't stop hurting

It just wont stop hurting'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
