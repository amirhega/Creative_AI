At first when I heard of some people who claim
That the old-time religion was real
I said "I'll go down, take a look at the crowd
For just that weakminded I feel."

I walked up the steps and I peeked in the door
But the Devil said, "Don't you go in!"
But I said, "It won't hurt me I'll just step inside
And I'll set as far back as I can." (But)

Something got a hold of me (Praise God)
Yes something got a hold of me (Oh! Lord)
I went there to fight, but I'll tell you that night
God certainly got a hold of me.

They sang like they meant it, they all clapped their hands
I said, "It's commotion, that's all." 
"When they get down to pray, I'll just get up and leave
For I don't wanta be seen here at all."

But I bowed that time, he got started to preach
And he looked straight down at me
He told ev'rybody how mean that I was
He didn't talk like he thought much of me.

I sat in my seat just thinkin' it o'er
And then they all started to pray
The fire fell from Heaven, I fell to the floor
I prayed there and God had His way. (For)

Something got a hold of me (Praise God)
Yes something got a hold of me (Oh! Lord)
I went there to fight, but I'll tell you that night
God certainly got a hold of me.''''''''''''''''''
