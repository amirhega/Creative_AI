I was there that night in Bethlehem
And when Neil and the boys came to the moon in that tin can
At Gettysburg, Omaha beach, in Vietnam
I heard every soldier's cry and mom's prayer
I was there

I was there when you took your first breath
And when you lit that stolen Lucky Strike and like the choke to death
When you were waist deep in Carter's Creek
And preacher John dunked you down in the water and raised you up for air
I was there
I'm always around
I was then and I am now
And I'll be here when tomorrow comes
When a road comes to an end
I'm where you start again
I'm never farther than a word away
You've always got a friend

When your grandma passed, I was in that house
And when your grandpa ran down the street to go to show her around
I was there

I'm always around
I was then and I am now
And I'll be here when tomorrow comes
When a road comes to an end
I'm where you start again
I'm never farther than a word away
You've always got a friend

I was there last night on highway 9
When you answered the phone and ran right through that stop sign
I was in the cab, in that bigger rig, in that trucker's ear
They then swerve to the right and miss you by a hair
I was there

If you're feeling alone look up on the One who answers prayers
And I'm always there''''''''''''''''''
