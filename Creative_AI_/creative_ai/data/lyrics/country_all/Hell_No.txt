Guess it slipped my mind: now I'm in trouble deep.
For the last two years in a row,
I forgot our anniversary.
So I come rushin' in: twelve roses in bloom.
Said: "Honey would you like a romantic evening,
"Out under the stars and the moon?" 

She didn't say: "No."
But in her eyes I could see,
That this wouldn't turn out to be,
The enchanted evenin' I thought it might be.
Yes, I sure found out,
Got a long way to go.
She didn't say no:
She said: "Hell, no."

An' we split the sheets,
Ah, 'bout six months ago.
I told all my buddies down at the bar:
"This cowboy's headed home."
Walked into her house,
Yeah, climbed right up in her bed:
When I asked her if she still loved me,
Man, you know what she said?

Whoa, she didn't say: "No."
But in her eyes I could see,
That this wouldn't turn out to be,
The fairy-taled ending I thought it might be.
An' I sure found out,
I got a long way to go.
She didn't say no:
She said: "Hell, no."

Yeah, I sure found out,
I got a long way to go.
She didn't say no:
She said: "Hell, no."

Ah.''''''''''''''''''
