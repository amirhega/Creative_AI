Sometimes think that war is necessary
Every night I pray for peace on Earth
I hand out my dollars to the homeless
But believe that every able soul should work
My Father gave me my shotgun
That I'll hand down to my son
Try to teach him everything it means

I'm a man of my convictions
Call me wrong
Call me right
But I bring my better angels to every fight
You may not like where I'm goin'
But you sure know where I stand
Hate me if you want to
Love me if you can

I stand by my right to speak freely
But I worry 'bout what kids learn from TV
And before all the debating turns to words and hate
Something we should just agree to disagree
I believe that Jesus
Looks down here and sees us
If you ask Him he would say

I'm a man of my convictions
Call me wrong
Call me right
But I bring my better angels to every fight
You may not like where I'm goin'
But you sure know where I stand
Hate me if you want to
Love me if you can

I'm a man of my convictions
Call me wrong
Call me right
But I bring my better angels to every fight
You may not like where I'm goin'
But you sure know where I stand
Hate me if you want to
Love me if you can''''''''''''''''
