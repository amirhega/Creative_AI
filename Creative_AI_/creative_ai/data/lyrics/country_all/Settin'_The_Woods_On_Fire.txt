Comb your hair and paint on powder
You act proud, and I'll act prouder
You sing loud and I'll sing louder 
Tonight we're settin' the woods on fire

You're my gal and I'm your feller 
Dress up in your frock of yeller
I'll look swell, but you'll look sweller
Settin' the woods on fire

We'll take in all the honky tonks
Tonight we're havin' fun
We'll show the folks a brand new dance
That never has been done

I don't care who thinks we're silly
You be daffy and I'll be dilly
We'll order up two bowls of chilli
Settin' the woods on fire

I'll gas up my hot rod stoker
We'll get hotter than a poker
You'll be broke, but I'll be broker
Tonight we're settin' the woods on fire

We'll set close to one another
Up one street and down the other
We'll have a time, oh brother
Settin' the woods on fire

We'll put aside a little time
To fix a flat or two
My tires and tubes are doin' fine
But the air is showin' through

You clap hands and I'll start bowin'
We'll do all the laws allowin'
Tomorrow I'll be right back plowin'
Settin' the woods on fire'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
