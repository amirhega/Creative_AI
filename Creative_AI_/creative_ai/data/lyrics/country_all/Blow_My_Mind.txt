Tell me brother, sisters do you listen when it rains?
Are you worried something's going to end it all today?
Is there anything that you had wished that you had said
Or is it all just bouncing like a bubble in your head?
Run, run till you're far away
Run, run till you're far away

'Cause if you want to blow my mind
Blow my mind, blow my mind
If you want to blow my mind
Blow my mind, blow my mind
Boom boom diddy diddy
Boom boom diddy diddy
Boom boom diddy diddy boom
Hey!
Boom boom diddy diddy
Boom boom diddy diddy
Boom boom diddy diddy boom
Hey!

Heart's a motor bigger than a super nova train
Shame it's got to deal with all the demons in your brain
Tell me when you're ready we can kiss and say goodbye
Or if you want to, me and a few friends are gonna fly
Run, run till you're far away
Run, run till you're far away

If you want to blow my mind it's time for you to start the show
If you want to blow my mind it's time for you to let it go

Boom boom diddy diddy
Boom boom diddy diddy
Boom boom diddy diddy boom
Hey!
Boom boom diddy diddy
Boom boom diddy diddy
Boom boom diddy diddy boom
Hey!''''&'''&''&'''&''&'''''''
