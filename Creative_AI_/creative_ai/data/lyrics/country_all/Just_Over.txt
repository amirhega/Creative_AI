She called and said she wanted to see me
I say, "Yeah, that's fine, baby, drop on by"
I figured I could make it better
Just like every other time we had this fight
Of all the kind of over it could've been
I never would've bet on this

I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over
Drink over, then it would be over
Back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on
She's gone, she ain't pulling over
It's just over

When she left the kitchen, she left no questions
I said where in the world did I go wrong?
And it don't matter where she's headed
She's gone, gone, gone

I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over
Drink over, then it would be over
Back how it used to be
No, to but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on
She's gone, she ain't pulling over
It's just over

Like the page, she's turning over
Like the light, she's starting over
Without me

I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over
Drink over, then it would be over
Back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on
She's gone, she ain't pulling over
It's just over
It's just over
Yeah, it's just over
It's just over''''''''''''''''''
