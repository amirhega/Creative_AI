Here's my hat in my hand
Planin' to do somethin' bad
Will you step aside please?
I ain't stay to mid (midnight)
I always tryin' to help
But I ain't do much than I did
I loved since childhood
Made you real as I could
After all you said goodbye
Gotta go with my bal
Let me tell somethin' real frank
U'll be back soon not far
U'll cry to bag me later
But I ain't be quicker
Look at your self right now
And look at you later on
U'll see the different baby
U ain't look like before...
Sad and tired with your life''''''''''''''''
