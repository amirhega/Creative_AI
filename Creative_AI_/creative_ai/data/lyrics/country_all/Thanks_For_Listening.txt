That six string dreams when I was a kid
Playing in the air guitar wishing I was a star
Just wanted a chance to stand up here
And play a few songs for ya all
Now when I look out and see all these smiles
After all these shows and all these miles
There's a feeling in my soul that makes it all worth

And I wanna say: Thanks! Thanks for listening
So just raise your beer let me hear you cheer
To all those friends that I'm missing
And I wanna say: Thanks for coming out tonight
You gotta sing along to your favorite song
And I hope ya all got a good time
And I wanna say: Thanks! Na-na-na
Thanks! Na-na-na
Thanks! Na-na-na
Thanks for listening

It ain't los on me that you made your choice
To love my songs and hear my voice
The Facebook nation call the radio station
Try to get all colt a few spin
Now speaking from the heart which is all I know
Every single night, every single show
Time to give thanks where thanks are due
You all more than fans you're my friends too

Thanks! Thanks for listening
So just raise your beer let me hear you cheer
To all those friends that I'm missing
And I wanna say: Thanks for coming out tonight
You gotta sing along to your favorite song and I hope ya all got a good time
I wanna say: Thanks! Na-na-na
Thanks! Na-na-na
Thanks! Na-na-na, thanks,
Thanks for listening

To my friends o Twitter try to find a babysitter
Girls car broke down and you gotta go get her
And all you gotta do is make it to the show
I wanna say: Thanks! Thanks for listening
So just raise your beer let me hear you cheer
To all those friends that I'm missing
And I wanna say: Thanks for coming out tonight
You gotta sing along to your favorite song and I hope ya all got a good time
I wanna say: Thanks! Na-na-na
