Old toy trains, little toy tracks
Little toy drums, coming from a sack
Carried by a man dressed in white and red
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed

Close your eyes and listen to the skies
All is calm and all is well
Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells

Bringing old toy trains, little toy tracks
Little toy drums, coming from a sack
Carried by a man dressed in white and red
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed

Close your eyes and listen to the skies
All is calm and all is well
Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells

Bringing old toy trains, little toy tracks
Little toy drums, coming from a sack
Carried by a man dressed in white and red
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed''''''''''''''''
