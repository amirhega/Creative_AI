Promise me we won't go to sleep with this poison on our lips
Let's take a breath while there's something left
And there's love left to give

Let's don't let our last words be the bad words
We know we'll still hurt tomorrow
We can't let this cruel wall be our downfall
A prideful pill we can't swallow

You know me well enough to tear the soul right out of me
And I know how to turn you inside out so please before we speak

Leave it all unsaid, leave this war outside our bed
Lay down our heads and dream instead''''&''&''&''&''&''''&''
