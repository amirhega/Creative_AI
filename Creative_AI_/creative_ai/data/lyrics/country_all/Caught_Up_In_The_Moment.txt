She was sittin' at a bar in LAX, readin' Cosmo "how to have good sex"
When she saw him walking through the security check
Well she gave him a wink, said, "come over here, hey hey good lookin'
Can I buy you a beer?" It's like Nelly said, "It's gettin' hot in here!"
She said, "I'm headin' out to Vegas on a 747 in 35 minutes down at gate 11
If you wanna get lucky I'll take you to Heaven
He said, "I got a million dollar meeting up in New York City
If I ain't there it'll be a cryin' pity, but somethin' 'bout you's too damn pretty!"

Yeah, they got a caught up in the moment, couldn't help themselves
They got caught up in the moment, got wild as hell
It was everything they wanted right then and there
They got caught up in the moment, caught up, caught up

At 20,000 feet on a South West flight she whispered to him, "We ain't got all night"
So he reached up and turned off the overhead light
And by the time they landed sure enough it was more than lust, but less then love
Ther were full-fledged members of the "you know what club"!

He was 10 grand up at a blackjack table, she was dressed to the nines
Drinkin' fine Black Lable he said, "I think I'm gonna cash out and buy you a diamond ring"
So they headed down the strip to the wedding chapel in a stretch limousine that was
Candy Apple, got married by a preacher man that looked just like the king!''''&'''&''&'''&''&'''''''
