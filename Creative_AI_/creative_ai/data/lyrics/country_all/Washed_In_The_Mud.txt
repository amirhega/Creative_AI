I made a pit stop at the corner station
In my shiny new rig where the boys were waiting
Got it all gassed up and the beer rise down
Drove 35 miles outside of town

Where the ground holds water long after the rain
We can slip, slide, and run this thing
Get it all dirty, break it and ride
Round here trucks get baptized

Washed, washed in the mud
We get it all jacked up, sink it to the struts
Show it some hillbilly love
Gonna get washed, washed in the mud
Yeah, we rolling like Rambo, covered in camo
Truck's being born again
Can I get a amen?

It was well worth every single dollar
'Cause it makes the country girls yell, scream and holler
Got a heavy duty winch that'll pull you from a ditch
And a set of bull nuts hanging off a ball hitch

Tunes, wipers, stompin' in time
A sweet little honey sittin' by my side
Throw it in low, put it to the task
Come on baby can I get a witness

Washed, washed in the mud
We get it all jacked up, sink it to the struts
Show it some hillbilly love
Gonna get washed, washed in the mud
Yeah, we rolling like Rambo, covered in camo
My truck's being born again
Can I get a amen?

Brothers and sisters, we're all gathered here today
To celebrate that country life that we all love so much
Now we may not have fancy things and all that glitters ain't gold
But them old trucks out there in the parking lot are just like Jesus
They good for a country folk soul

Washed, washed in the mud
We get it all jacked up, sink it to the struts
Show it some hillbilly love
Gonna get washed, washed in the mud
Yeah, we rolling like Rambo, covered in camo
My truck's being born again
Can I get a amen?

Washed in the mud, washed in the mud, washed in the mud...
Can I get a amen?''''''''''''''''''
