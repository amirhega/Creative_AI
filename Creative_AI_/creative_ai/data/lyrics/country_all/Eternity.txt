INTRO - John Legend:
I've been looking for so long to find this place I see
And I've just got to believe it's more than a dream
Seems it's time I should move on
But I hope you come with me
Till we find eternity



Doing all I can to make things better
Everything I can to get things right
Baby when you're me, it's a little more like Heaven
Here in my mind, here in my mind

I've been looking for so long to find this place I see
And I've just got to believe it's more than a dream
Seems it's time I should move on
But I hope you come with me
Till we find eternity

We just can't let this old world get us down
There's too much beauty in this life
It should be so perfect
We shouldn't know we've made it to the other side
When we make it to the other side

Oh you know it's got to be so beautiful
Oh and everybody is so free
Love, love is the only thing there is between you and me''''&''&''&''&''&''''''
