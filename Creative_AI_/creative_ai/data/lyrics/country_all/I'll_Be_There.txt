When you need picked up 'cause you fell down
Need a piggyback ride on a birthday clown
Need a song to take you to sleepy town
I'll be there

When you need a coach or you need a fan
Need a castle built out of ocean sand
Or a rainbow chaser, I'm your man
I'll be there

I'll be a tear dryer, a paper airplane flyer
A monster runner-offer if you get scared
I'll be a sap, I'll be a sucker, a story maker-upper
Anytime, anything, anywhere
I'll be there

When you break your heart or skin your knee
Need a big ol' hug or a bowl of ice cream
I promise you can count on me

I'll be a heart mender, a prayer sender
A hoper and believer when it's all up in the air
A strong and steady shoulder, I'll be a secret holder
Anytime, anything, anywhere
I'll be there

If you need a frown turned to a grin
Or you need a hand just to hold your hand
Need a daddy or you just need a friend
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
