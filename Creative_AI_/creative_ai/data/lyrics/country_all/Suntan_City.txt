(It's 'bout that time a year again!)
It was bumper to bumper when I hit that county
So I stopped and let the top down;

Speakers where a bumpin',
Little hip-hop somethin'
I was stirrin' up a coke and crown;

Didn't even check in the room,
We went straight for the beach,
Didn't even give the ice a chance to melt;

Now I'm scoutin' my spot,
Where we were gunna rock,
With the biggest buzz I ever felt

Now I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
Got the best view in the world,
Spendin' my days catchin' these rays,
Watchin coconut covered girls

They keep strollin' by,
And they keep rollin' in,
Like the waves on the sand

Yeah, I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
With a cold one in my hand
(Whoooo!)

Hey there cutie with a Kentuky coozie,
Have you ever hung with a Georgia boy?
And why don't you and your friends,
Ease on over here and chug a beer with Miss Illinois?

Yeah I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
Got the best view in the world,
Spendin' my days catchin' these rays,
Watchin coconut covered girls

They keep strollin' by,
And they keep rollin' in,
Like the waves on the sand

Yeah, I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
With a cold one in my hand

I gotta buddy who blew all his money,
And he had to stay his broke-ass home,
He's been goin' crazy, blowin' up my phone
Wantin' to know what's goin' on

I tell him I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
Got the best view in the world,
Spendin' my days catchin' these rays,
Watchin coconut covered girls

And they keep strollin' by,
And they keep rollin' in,
Like the waves on the sand

Yeah, I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
With a cold one in my hand
(Yeah!)

Sittin' pretty, right here in Suntan City''''''''''''''''''
