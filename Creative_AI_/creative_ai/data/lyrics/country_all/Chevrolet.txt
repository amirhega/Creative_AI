Luke Bryan - Chevrolet

I'm gonna find a way to love again
I'm on the winnin' stretch of a losin' end
Foot on the gas, I'm freedom bound
I've got the morning sun at my back, and I'm inspired
Nothing can slow me down
She used to get me.
I was held back by her memory.

Let the highway sing
A song of a new beginning, keep these wheels a spinnin'.
Gonna hammer down
While the distant sky is wakin', light behind me's breakin.
I found a better way, in the form of a Chevrolet.

A strange reminder of how I walked a step behind her
Back here in the shadows of an 18-wheeler
Where I'm headin I still don't know
But I caught the wind of an AM station
Blarin on my radio.
I ain't lookin' back.
I never though I could say that. So''''''''''''''''
