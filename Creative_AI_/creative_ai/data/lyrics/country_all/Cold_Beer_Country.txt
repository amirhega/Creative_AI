So dang hot you want to sit around naked
Ain't rained one drop, ain't gonna I reckon
Lying old weatherman told me the truth
About today, tomorrow and the next day too

It's cold beer country
110 in the shade
An iced tea won't cut it
And neither will lemonade
I need a cold Budweiser on a bar stool
And a jukebox by my dear
Singing cold beer country
'Cause it's cold beer country round here

I've been getting out and getting in it all day long
Tonight I'm going out and getting it on
Sipping on a long neck working on a bug
'Cause that's what everybody does

It's cold beer country
110 in the shade
An iced tea won't cut it
And neither will lemonade
I need a cold Budweiser on a bar stool
And a jukebox by my dear
Singing cold beer country
'Cause it's cold beer country round here

Here comes my baby
About as hot as she can be
We're gonna pop the cap, gonna knock them back
Nothing better for the July heat

It's cold beer country
110 in the shade
An iced tea won't cut it
And neither will lemonade
I need a cold Budweiser on a bar stool
And a jukebox by my dear
Singing cold beer country
'Cause it's cold beer country round here
Yeah, singing cold beer country
It's cold beer country round here
Ah yeah''''''''''''''''''
