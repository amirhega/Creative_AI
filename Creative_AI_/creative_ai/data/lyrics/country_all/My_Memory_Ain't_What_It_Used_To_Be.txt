It must have been a mountain standing in our way
Or some small misunderstanding
We talked about too late
Was it the kitchen or the bedroom
Where we let a good thing go
Was it destined dreams, or space we needed?
I don't know.

Baby, lately my memory
Ain't what it used to be at all
It's crazy, but holding you close to me
Seeing you smile at me
Is all that I recall
'Cause baby it don't matter how hard I try
I still can't remember why we said goodbye

Maybe time's just playing tricks on me these days
Or maybe these old feelings never went away
'Cause all that I remember
Is that I'm still in love with you

And if I'm losing my mind, I hope you are too

Baby, lately my memory
Ain't what it used to be at all
It's crazy, but holding you close to me
Seeing you smile at me
Is all that I recall
'Cause baby it don't matter how hard I try
I still can't remember why we said goodbye
Goodbye

It's crazy
But holding you close to me
Seeing you smile at me
Is all that I recall
'Cause baby, it don't matter how hard I try
I still can't remember why we said goodbye
Why we said goodbye
Why did we say goodbye?'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
