Well we're comin' to your city
Gonna play our guitars and sing you a country song
We'll all be flyin' higher than a jet airliner
And if you want a little bang in your yin yang come along

Well we blew through Cincinnati
And we all got really happy
Grabbed a bowl of that Skyline Chili along the way
Then we rolled on into Canton
Scared the hell our of Marilyn Manson
And the party started happenin'
Hey, hey, hey

And in the middle of a Charleston night
We ran into Jessica White
And a little moonshine got us right plum smacked insane

Well, we broke down in Greenville
In the middle of a hay field
But a Bud Light truck pulled up and helped us out

So we then headed up to Philly
Partied down like real hillbillies
Brought the Music Mafia
And rocked it out

And Chippewa's where we go
When we're up in Buffalo
Don't you know those Yankees drink enough to drown!

Listen up!
Now L.A.'s got the freaks
At Pink's and fifteen dollar drinks
And San Antonio was a wild, wild rodeo

And then Phoenix, Arizona
We drank way too much Corona
And we woke up by the river
In Jeff City, Mo.

Yeah, yeah
We're comin' to your city
We're gonna play our guitars and sing you a country song
We'll all be flyin' higher than a jet airliner
And if you want a little band in your yin yang
If you wanna little zing in your zang zang
If you wanna little ting in your tang tang
Come along, come along, come along, come along

Yeah, we're comin' to your city'''''&''''&'''&''''&'''&'''''''''''
