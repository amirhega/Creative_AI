Baby when I look at you, with them baby blues
Cuttin' right through me
You set me on the rewind, back to the good times
When you couldn't get enough of me
I guess I givin' myself away
Sayin' all the things I never did say
I lose myself, there's nothing else I can do
Baby, when I look at you

Yeah, baby when I look at you

Last thing I thought I'd see was
You across the bar from me
And holdin' on to that turkey bottle
Shootin' 'em down, and runnin' full throttle
Oh I can still taste the last time
You and me and nothin' but the tan lines
Keeps runnin' through my my mind
On and on and on and on and

Baby when I look at you, with them baby blues
Cuttin' right through me
You set me on the rewind, back to the good times
When you couldn't get enough of me
I guess I givin' myself away
Sayin' all the things I never did say
I lose myself, there's nothing else I can do
Baby, when I look at you

Yeah, baby when I look at you

Well I know you know I'm a watchin'
Your low cut on the dance floor rockin'
Got the whole place worked up and locked in
With every move so sexy it's shockin'
Girl you sure do know how to serve it
The way I did ya Lord I deserve it
You know my heart, you know how to hurt it

On and on and on and on and

Baby when I look at you, with them baby blues
Cuttin' right through me
You set me on the rewind, back to the good times
When you couldn't get enough of me
I guess I givin' myself away
Sayin' all the things I never did say
I lose myself, there's nothing else I can do
Baby, when I look at you

Yeah, baby when I look at you

Well, I could start a tab and run it up
Or close it out and head to my truck
And drive away as fast as I can
And forget we ever loved

Baby when I look at you, with them baby blues
They're cuttin' right through me
You set me on the rewind, back to the good times
When you couldn't get enough of me
I guess I givin' myself away
Sayin' all the things I never did say
I lose myself, there's nothing else I can do
Oh, I lose myself, there's nothing else I can do
Baby, when I look at you
Yeah, baby, when I look at you

Baby when I look at you, with them baby blues
They're cuttin' right through me''''&''&''&''&''''''&''&
