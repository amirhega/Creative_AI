I gotta get to you baby, I gotta get to you now
Without you I'm going crazy, without you girl I'm going wild
The only thing that I wanna do is fall into you

Baby when the lights go out
I wanna hear that want you sound
On your lips when I lay you down (down down down)
I wanna love you 'til there's nothing left
All night until the sky turns red
Do everything that we ain't done yet
But we been thinkin' about
Baby when the lights go out
Baby when the lights go out

A day can feel like forever, baby when you're not around
Yeah when we ain't together, you're all I dream about
I'm turning corners I'm driving, over to your house

Baby when the lights go out
I wanna hear that want you sound
On your lips when I lay you down (down down down)
I wanna love you 'til there's nothing left
All night until the sky turns red
Do everything that we ain't done yet
But we been thinkin' about
Baby when the lights go out
Baby when the lights go out

The only thing that I wanna do, is fall into you
Baby when the lights go out

Baby when the lights go out
I wanna hear that want you sound
On your lips when I lay you down (down down down)
I wanna love you 'til there's nothing left
All night until the sky turns red
Do everything that we ain't done yet
But we been thinkin' about
Baby when the lights go out
Baby when the lights go out'''''''''''''''''''''''
