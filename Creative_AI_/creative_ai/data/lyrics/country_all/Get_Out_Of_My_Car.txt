I like your banjo in there

Girl, you drank all my beer
And the whiskey's all gone
I'm sittin' here
Ready to get it on

You got me thinkin' you won't
You got me thinkin' you might
And it's 3 o'clock in the mornin'
And I can't beat around the bush all night

We've already kissed
(We've already kissed)
We've already danced
(We've already danced)

You're wonderin' if
You ought to put on your shoes
Or pull down your pants
(Come on, pull down your pants)

What would it hurt?
Pull off that shirt
Babe, we've already come this far
Get out of your clothes
Or get out of my car

Whichever you choose
I'm ready to go
I could take you to the house, baby
Or I can drive it on home

We can do it right here
Or do it somewhere else
But make up your mind
Do something quick
Or I'm gonna do it myself

We've already kissed
(We've already kissed)
And we've already danced
(We've already danced)

You're wonderin' if
You ought to put on your shoes
Or pull down your pants
(Come on, pull down your pants)

What would it hurt?
Take off that shirt
Babe, we've already come this far
Get out of your clothes
Or get out of my car

We're gonna drive around a little while then
Let's do it over here in the middle, babe

We've already kissed
(We've already kissed)
We've already danced
(We've already danced)

And you're wonderin' if
You oughta pull off my boots
Or pull down your pants
(Come on, pull down your pants)

Hey, what would it hurt?
Take off that shirt
Babe, we've already come this far
Get out of your clothes
Or get out of my car
(Get out of my car)

I got out of my clothes
She got out of my car

What's up, babe?
Bye, bye, boredom
