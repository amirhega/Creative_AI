Buddies
They roll up in the mornin'
And hand you a coffee
Tell ya hurry up
The fish ain't gonna wait on you

Buddies
They don't give you no warning
When they shoot up a stop sign
Out on some ol' country road

I've got ones that I've fought with
And out run the law with
Ones that I'd give my last dime
If I had it

One on the wagon
And one out there draggin'
A plow behind
An old John Deere

They work hard for their money
Their trucks all stay muddy
All my beer drinkin', deer draggin'
Dusty dirt road riddin'
Buddies

Buddies
They smell trouble 'fore it happens
And when it starts to happen
They're right with you
Rollin' in a parking lot

Buddies
They make you girlfriend so mad
Keep your momma from sleepin'
'Cause they both know too well that

I've got ones that I've fought with
And out run the law with
Ones that I'd give my last dime
If I had it

One on the wagon
And one out there draggin'
A plow behind
An old John Deere

They work hard for their money
Their trucks all stay muddy
All my beer drinkin', deer draggin'
Dusty dirt road riddin'
Buddies

I got one on a humvee
That keeps all of us free
And one that got his heartbroke
And went half crazy

Got one that moved far away
One that rings my phone everyday
And one when he hears this
He'll shed a tear

They work hard for their money
Their boots all stay muddy
All my beer drinkin', deer draggin'
Dusty dirt road riddin'
Trash talkin' buddies
All true''''''''''''''''
