You can take a lesson from an old coal miner
Go and get you a shovel and dig clear to China
But there's nothing, no, there's nothing
Deeper than my love

You can drop in the ocean in a deep-diving submarine
You can sit on the bottom, down where there's nothing to see
But there's nothing, no, there's nothing
Deeper than my love

Girl it ain't nothing better than you and me together
It's now and forever right down to the letter
And I won't ever, never ever get enough
'Cause there's nothing (nothing, nothing) deeper than my love

Girl you know I want you down in my country soul
You can look into my eyes as far as you wanna go
'Cause there's nothing, no, there's nothing
Deeper than my love

You know there ain't nothing better than you and me together
It's now and forever right down to the letter
And I won't ever, never ever get enough
'Cause there's nothing (nothing, nothing) deeper than my love

No, there ain't nothing better than you and me together
It's now and forever right down to the letter
And I won't ever, never ever get enough

No, there ain't nothing bigger as far as I can figure
It ain't nothing longer, it ain't nothing stronger
Baby I'm yours, sure as there's a Lord above
And there's nothing (nothing, nothing) deeper than my love

Deeper than my love
Deeper than my love''''''''''''''''''
