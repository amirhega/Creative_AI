Well it's just another mornin' at the Shady Rest
Home for the aged and the convalesced
Let's take a little strong down the wild west wing
And see what's a happening

Now Harry's in the first room down the hall
But he ain't a poppin' pills sipping Geritol
I ask him what the secret is of '93
He says a double dose of Bassy and a Ella Fitz G

Keep on, Keep on a Rockin'
Keep on a Rockin' till you're dead and gone
Clock on the wall gets a tick tock
And put the boogie woogie woogie as your antidote
You gotta Keep on a Rockin' or you'll turn to stone

Now Darla is a diva in the 102
Singing show stoppers and dancing with a broom
Her boyfriend Floyd is quite the catch
'Cause he can play his dentures like castanets

Now Wanda's in a walker and she's on the move
A pink house coat and a blue suede shoes
Rosie is her roomie and she's frail and brave
As she can skeedle oopa deedle dweedle deedle all day

Keep on, Keep on a Rockin'
Keep on a Rockin' till you're dead and gone
Clock on the wall gets a tock tick tock
And put the boogie woogie woogie as your antidote
You gotta Keep on a Rockin' or you'll turn to stone

(Instrumental)

Every now and then when the Moon is full
A walkin' cane stuck in the door handle
The doctors and the nurses just look the other way
As the whole place starts to shake

They take the microphone where they play Bingo
Shove it in the speaker of a stereo
The saxophone shrieks and the bass drum pounds
But they never never never never never turn it down

You gotta Keep on, Keep on a Rockin'
Keep on a Rockin' till you're dead and gone
Clock on the wall gets a tock tick tock
And put the boogie woogie woogie as your antidote
You gotta Keep on a Rockin' or you'll turn to stone

Keep on, Keep on a Rockin'
Keep on a Rockin' till you're dead and gone
Clock on the wall gets a tock tick tock
And put the boogie woogie woogie as your antidote
You gotta Keep on a Rockin' or you'll turn to stone'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
