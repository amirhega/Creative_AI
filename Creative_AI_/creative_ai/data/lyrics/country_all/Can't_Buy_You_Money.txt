I got a sweet little woman: she knows that I love her true.
I gotten three little kids on the floor an' they love their Daddy too.
I got a one on the way an' I don't think I can pay the doctor bill.
I never finished payin' the last one off: don't guess I ever will.
Yeah, we'd save it all up for a rainy day, but it's always sunny.
Guess all the happiness in the world can't buy you money.

I got an old work truck, it'll barely get me to town and back.
I try an' put in a little more overtime but that don't pay no jack.
So I bring it home where my baby's got my hot supper fixed.
Yeah, then I lay down my weary bones an' get back up at six.
Just workin' hard in the land of the milk and honey.
Hey, all the happiness in the world can't buy you money. 

But if I had plenty, I could keep us afloat.
Yeah, then in the end if my ship don't come in,
I'd just buy a big boat.
Now, I ain't got no money, Lord, I mean, deep in debt.
We must be livin' on love from above,
'Cause we ain't hit bottom yet.

I pick my pay-check up an' go straight to the bank: that's my usual route.
An' then I go home an' pick up the wife an' kids 'cause we're goin' out, yeah.
Then it's a drive-through window an' pick out a combo, super-size.
Yeah, then swing on down to the Walmart an' let the kids pick out a prize.
My truck broke down at the red-lioght: she thinks it's real funny.
Guess all the happiness in the world can't buy you money.

Yeah, we'd save it all up for a rainy day, but it's always sunny.
Guess all the happiness in the world can't buy you money.
Money.
Can't buy you money.
Money.'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
