All the things I've felt and never shared.
All the times that she was lonely with me there.
Tears I wouldn't let fall from my eyes.
And how I let her go without a fight.

The reasons I'm alone, I know by heart. 
But I don't wanna spend forever in the dark. 
I swear next time I'll hang on for dear life. 
If love ever gives me another try.

There's no changing things that we regret. 
The best that we can hope for is one more chance. 
If the hands of time could just move in reverse. 
I wouldn't make the same mistake again with her. 

The reasons I'm alone, I know by heart. 
But I don't wanna spend forever in the dark. 
I swear next time I'll hang on for dear life. 
If love ever gives me another try.	

Oh, the reasons I'm alone I know by heart. 
But I don't wanna spend forver in the dark. 
I swear next time I'll hang on for dear life, 
If love ever gives me another try. 

Oh if love ever gives me another try.''''''''''''''''''
