Middle of December ain't the time to be alone
It's just too close to Christmas and too far to go home
Ran in to a friend of a friend standing in a checkout line
She said, "I've spent too much already and there's gifts I just can't find"
I walked her home and when she opened up her door
Oh, I'm not sure what happened then, guess magic took it's course

Blame it on the mistletoe, 'cause what happened here nobody knows
How could something simple as a kiss change my holiday like this?
And we held each other all night long
And we fell asleep to a Christmas song
Playin' on the radio, blame it on the mistletoe

I woke up, she was wrappin' gifts beneath the tree
She said, "I know it's early, so I thought I'd let you sleep"
Then she insisted I get up and take a look outside
Hey sleepyhead, it must have snowed at least a foot last night
That's when I saw it hangin' up above my head
She threw her arms around my neck, laughin' as she said

"Blame it on the mistletoe, 'cause what happened here nobody knows
How could something simple as a kiss change my holiday like this?"
And we held each other all night long
And we fell asleep to a Christmas song
Playin' on the radio, blame it on the mistletoe''''''''''''''''''''
