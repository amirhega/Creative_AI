Reservations for one tonight
I'll be eating by myself again
At that quiet little corner spot
Where we use to hang with all our friends

Then I'll ease down to the local pub
And climb up on the tallest stool
Holding cord with my common sense
Out waiting all these common fools

I've got good taste for blended whiskey
I can see my way around this bar
I can hear sound of a vintage jukebox
And smell the smoke of a hand rolled cigar
I can't read your mind
Baby I can sense this much
When it comes to your love
I feel like I'm losing my touch

You're not buying this anymore
My lies have come up short again
You havent said it's over yet
Oh, but I can feel a bitter wind

And after giving me your better years
And hoping for the very best
Closing time is drawing near
As I sit alone with all the rest

Well, I've got good taste for blended whiskey
I can see my way around this bar
I can hear sounds of a vintage jukebox
And smell the smoke of a hand rolled cigar
I can't read your mind
Oh, But I can sense this much
When it comes to your love
I feel like I'm losing my touch

When comes to your love
I feel like I'm losing my touch''''''''''''''''''
