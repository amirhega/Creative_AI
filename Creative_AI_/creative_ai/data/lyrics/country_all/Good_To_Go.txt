Waitin' at a stop light yesterday
As a funeral procession made its way
Through the gates
I watched it roll up a winding road
Through a field of green
With white headstones
All in a row
And it made me think about where I'm at
On my not so straight and narrow path
All the generous and mostly undeserved
Blessings that I've had

I had an all-American mom and dad
Some of the coolest friends you could ever have
Found love I thought I'd never find
Sometimes I can't believe this life in mine
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go
I'm good to go

I said a prayer for the dearly departed
And the loved ones left broken hearted
Then traffic started
And I drove away a little more able
To see the good things on my table
And for that I'm grateful
'Cause I've had my troubles and my trials
I've hit the mark and I've missed by miles
Had days that I've been fightin' mad
But the good times have more than
Outweighted the bad

Got to hold my newborn baby girl
And the hand of a man as he slipped from this world
I've laughed so hard I couldn't stop
Seen the sunrise from a mountain top
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go

Yeah, I've been thinkin' bout where I'm at
On my not so straight and narrow path
And I wouldn't wanna change nothing about
This roll with the punches life I've had

Had an all-American mom and dad
Some of the coolest friends you could ever have
Found love I thought I'd never find
I can't believe this life in mine
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go
I'm good to go
I'm good to go''''''''''''''''''
