Girl I know we just had the talk
Said we needed some time to cool it off
And I've been on my side of town, just staying low
You come walking in this little bar
Like you could set off that fire alarm
And one little drink won't hurt but don't you know

Girl we're lightning striking matches
That's what always happens
When we get too close
When you start dancing in the neon
Whisper baby dream on
Then the whiskey hits the coke
Next thing you know we're going up in smoke

We start out slow like a cigarette
Burn all night like we always did
They'll be sweeping up the ashes when we go
Yeah, we're playing with a fire we can't control
And we both know

Girl we're lightning striking matches
That's what always happens
When we get too close
When you start dancing in the neon
Whisper baby dream on
Then the whiskey hits the coke
Next thing you know we're going up in smoke

Going up, going up, going up in smoke
Going up, going up, going up in smoke
Going up, going up, going up in smoke
Going up, up, up in smoke

Girl we're lightning striking matches
That's what always happens
When we get too close
When you start dancing in the neon
Whisper baby dream on
Then the whiskey hits the coke
Next thing you know we're going up in smoke
Yeah, we're going up in smoke
Yeah, we're going up in smoke''''''''''''''''''
