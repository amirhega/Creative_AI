Out in the sticks and the squirrels and the ticks
Andy my 30-06, I'm runnin' out of Miller Light
Trucks in park, the dog won't bark
Couple hours till dark
Wishin' one would walk by
Might as well left my gun in the gun rack
Been here all day
All I killed's a twelve pack

Sittin' here waitin' on a deer, drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Aimin' at the empties, missin' hittin' pine trees
It ain't my fault them cans keep movin'
My baby's on the phone sayin' baby come home
Where you been and
What you've been doin'
We'll I've been, sittin' here, waitin' on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets

The only deer I've seen's been John Deere green
And that don't mean, that I got a raw deal
'Cause ain't no boss callin' me hoss
Tickin' me off on the edge of this cornfield
On my second box of Winchester hundred grains
Ain't seen a big buck but it's been a good day

Sittin' here, waitin' on a deer,'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
