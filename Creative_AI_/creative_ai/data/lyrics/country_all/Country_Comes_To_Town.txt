Well the weatherman said it might storm today
I gotta hit the field gotta bail some hay
And I can't let it rain on my daddys farm
Till I get it all stacked up high in the barn
And I'm gonna call my baby she's been waiting on me
She lives downtown on Sycamore street
And the wheels on the black top a starting to whine
As I pass that Oklahoma city limit sign

I'm a hayseed and a plow boy
I'm a farm kid and a cowboy
I'm a roughneck daddy was a roughneck too
I run around with hillbilly girls

The weekend sits on my hillbilly world
You better be ready when the sun goes down
That's when country comes to town

Daddy said child you better let him be
Well I don't like him and he sure don't like me
Mamma just says y'all have a little fun
Ain't doing nothin' me and Pappa ain't done
Open up the door to my pick-up truck
And my baby jumps in and she fires it up
And she gives me a kiss as I crawl in
We've been waiting all week for a weekend

I'm a hayseed and a plow boy
I'm a farm kid and a cowboy
I'm a roughneck daddy was a roughneck too
I run around with hillbilly girls''''''''''''''''
