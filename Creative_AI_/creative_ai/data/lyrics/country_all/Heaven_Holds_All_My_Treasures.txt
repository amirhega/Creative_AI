Some people struggle for riches
And all of the things they will buy
But all of my hopes for treasures
Are away beyond the skies

Heaven holds all my treasures
More precious than diamonds and gold
Up there I'll meet my darlin'
Whom God has called back to the fold

In this world, I'm just a drifter
I know nothing but sorrow
But to me somehow it don't matter
For I know she's waiting up there

Heaven holds all my treasures
More precious than diamonds and gold
Up there I'll meet my darlin'
Whom God has called back to the fold

I stand on the banks of the river
And I stare at the water so deep
And think of my darlin'
Then I bow my head and weep

Heaven holds all my treasures
More precious than diamonds and gold
Up there I'll meet my darlin'
Whom God has called back to the fold''''''''''''''''''
