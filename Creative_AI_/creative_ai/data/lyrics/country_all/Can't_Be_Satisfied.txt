As I'm watching you breathing, sleeping in my arms
Empty Champagne glasses on the floor
Holding you close, I'm so far from where we are

No I can't, I can't be satisfied
Tell the truth, you'd love it if I lied
The words I love always seem to twist me up inside
No I can't, I can't be satisfied

Everything that I love leads me straight to you
But these tangled sheets can't keep us in this room
I need you more than anything, but it's still not enough

No I can't, I can't be satisfied
Tell the truth, you'd love it if I lied
The words I love always seem to twist me up inside
No I can't, I can't be satisfied

It's so hard to leave tonight
Guess I'll leave this heart behind

No I can't, I can't be satisfied
Tell the truth, you'd love it if I lied
The words I love always seem to twist me up inside
No I can't, I can't be satisfied

No I can't, I can't be satisfied
Tell the truth, you'd love it if I lied
The words I love always seem to twist me up inside
No I can't, I can't be satisfied

No I can't, I can't be satisfied
Tell the truth, you'd love it if I lied
The words I love always seem to twist me up inside
No I can't, I can't be satisfied'''''&'''&'''&'''&'''&''''''&''''
