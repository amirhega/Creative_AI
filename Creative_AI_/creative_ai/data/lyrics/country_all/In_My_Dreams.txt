Some men dream of crossin' oceans
Some men dream one day to fly
Spend their whole lives out there floatin'
On the water and the sky

Some men dream of building fortunes
Some men dream of havin' fame
Nothin' else is more important
Than makin' money and a name

But In My Dreams I see
A little sky blue house
Beside a small stream
A front porch, a screen door
The sound of bare feet runnin' and cartoons
In My Dreams, your dreams come true

I come find you in your garden
Pullin' weeds between the rows
Trade a kiss for a glass of water
Sit and watch what love can grow

In My Dreams, your dreams
Are the only things
That really matter to me
When you smile, I smile
What makes you happy makes me happy too
In My Dreams, your dreams come true
In My Dreams, your dreams come true''''''''''''''''''
