She used to get her fix, with just one little kiss
Or a touch, could send her over the edge
I'd keep her up makin' love all night, had the stuff to make her feel alright
But now, she won't go near that ledge

She don't get high anymore, I don't make her fly like before
Her heart is out there soarin' somewhere else
I'm not the song that she sings, I can't give her those wings
Hard as I try, I'm not the sky she's looking for

She don't get high anymore

I remember when, she used to breathe me in
Back then, she couldn't get enough
We'd lay lookin' up at the clouds, I thought we'd never come down
She said my love, was like some kind of drug

She don't get high anymore, I don't make her fly like before
Her heart is out there soarin' somewhere else
I'm not the dream that she dreams, I can't give her those wings
Hard as I try, I'm not the sky she's looking for

She don't get high anymore

Oh, I'm not the song that she sings, I can't give her those wings
Hard as I try, I'm not the sky she's looking for

She don't get high anymore
She don't get high anymore
She don't get high, anymore
She don't get high
She don't get high, oh anymore''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
