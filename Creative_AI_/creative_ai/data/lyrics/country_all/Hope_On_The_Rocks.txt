Brady was a baseball star
Till he struck out and took his car and drove away, mmm
Sissy lost her little boy
And hitchhiked up to Illinois, so they say
Then it rained so hard that Mary tried to take her life with suicide
And disappear just like the thunder
You ask around and no one knows where they went or what they do
But you wonder
I know you wonder

Where do they go? They come here
To drown in their sorrow and cry in their beer
They're in need of a mind bender
I'm a bartender, and at the end of the day
I'm all they've got
Hope on the rocks

Charlie's wife filed for divorce
And Charlie bought a quarter horse and now he's riding fences
Upside down and couldn't pay
They hauled Sue's mobile home away and we ain't seen her since
Larry's long-time fianc√© got kicked out of the P.T.A.
And moved her kids back east with someone else
All the ones you used to know don't drop in or say hello
But you ask yourself
I know you ask yourself

Where do they go? They come here
To drown in their sorrow and cry in their beer
They're in need of a mind bender
I'm a bartender, and at the end of the day
I'm all they've got
Hope on the rocks

Where do they go? They come here
To drown in their sorrow and cry in their beer
They're in need of a mind bender
I'm a bartender, and at the end of the day
I'm all they've got
