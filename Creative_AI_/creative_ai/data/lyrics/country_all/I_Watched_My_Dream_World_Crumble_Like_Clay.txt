I built a dream world darlin' for two
Built it on hope and the love I thought was true
But I've seen my blue skies all turn to gray
I watched my dream world crumble like clay

We were so happy, darlin' we two
But then you changed dear, you found someone new
I saw all the joys of life fade far away
I watched my dream world crumble like clay

You promised darlin' that we'd never part
But now you've gone dear, breakin' my heart
I saw saw your love dear, fade and die away
I watched my dream world crumble like clay''''''''''''''''''
