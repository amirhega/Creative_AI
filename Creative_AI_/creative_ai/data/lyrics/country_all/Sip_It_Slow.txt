Sip it slow, kick back and let the cool breeze blow
Feel the grass up between your toes,
Take a deep breath for a minute
Sip it slow, somethin' this good gotta make last
If you let it slip by too fast, you going to wish you didn't miss it
Sip it slow

How's it son? I was just like you when I was there
Always in a hurry growin' up I thought it wasn't fair
Livin' fast like every moment might just be the last
See it's the future that you really want, who really needs the past
Makin' somethin' outta nothing that's what life's about
You keep the devil at your back even when you doubt
See it's your life son turn it up and let it rip
And don't forget to take a breath and just

Sip it slow, kick back and let the cool breeze blow
Feel the grass up between your toes,
Take a deep breath for a minute
Sip it slow, somethin' this good gotta make last
If you let it slip by too fast, you going to wish you didn't miss it
Sip it slow

Son I ain't preachin' I'm just teaching lessons that I've learned
'Cause I promised God that I would guide ya each and every turn
You can make a choice and let your voice stand up for right
Sometimes you turn the other cheek sometimes you gotta fight
You be a friend to a friend when they need you to
And I'll stand by ya until the end and help to see it through
See it's your life son turn it up and let it rip
And don't forget to take a breath and just

Sip it slow, kick back and let the cool breeze blow
Feel the grass up between your toes,
Take a deep breath for a minute
Sip it slow, somethin' this good gotta make last
If you let it slip by too fast, you going to wish you didn't miss it
Sip it slow

Thank you dad for giving me what I can give to mine
A lot of love a little luck I'm sure he'll be just fine
Love the journey of your life son but don't forget
To take a breath, sit back and just reminisce

Sip it slow, kick back and let the cool breeze blow
Feel the grass up between your toes,
Take a deep breath for a minute
Sip it slow, somethin' this good gotta make last
If you let it slip by too fast, you going to wish you didn't miss it
Sip it slow

Sip it slow, kick back and let the cool breeze blow
Feel the grass up between your toes,
Take a deep breath for a minute
Sip it slow, somethin' this good gotta make last
If you let it slip by too fast, you going to wish you didn't miss it
Sip it slow''''''''''''''''''
