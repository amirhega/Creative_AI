Daddy won a radio
He tuned it to a country show
I was rockin' in the cradle
To the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me
She taught me that sweet harmony
Now she worries 'cause she never thought
I'd ever really take it this far
Singin' in the bars

And chasin' that neon rainbow
Livin' that honky tonk dream
'Cause all I've ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
I'm chasin' that neon rainbow
Livin' that honky tonk dream

An atlas and a coffee cup
Five pickers and an old Dodge truck
Headin' down to Houston
For a show on Saturday night
This overhead is killin' me
Half the time, I sing for free
When the crowd's into it, Lord
It makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Standin' in the spotlight

Chasin' that neon rainbow
I'm livin' that honky tonk dream
'Cause all I've ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
I'm chasin' that neon rainbow
Livin' that honky tonk dream

Daddy's got a radio
He won it thirty years ago
He said, "Son, I just know
We're gonna hear you singin' on it some day"
I made it up to music row
Lordy, don't the wheels turn slow
Still I wouldn't trade a minute
I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage

I'm chasin' that neon rainbow
I'm livin' that honky tonk dream
'Cause all I've ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
I'm chasin' that neon rainbow
Livin' that honky tonk dream
Oh, I'm chasin' that neon rainbow
Livin' that honky tonk dream'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
