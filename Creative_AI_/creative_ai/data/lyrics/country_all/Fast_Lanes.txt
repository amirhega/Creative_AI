Not much for wearin' out my welcome
Always been that way and then some
Lonesome half the time
'Cause I need free and I need spacious
I get bothered, I get anxious just stoppin' at a red light
If I'm good at one thing, that's saying goodbye

I'm the reason they make fast lanes
My soul don't roll like no slow train
I hang my old hat in a new place
But it won't hang too long
Call me right or call me wrong
That's just my thing
I'm the reason they make fast lanes

When I left Georgia for the third time
I was closer to that state line than I ever was to her
Yeah, I could feel her fallin'
But somewhere down the road was callin'
And my wheels started to turn
It won't be the last time
And she ain't the first

I'm the reason they make fast lanes
My soul don't roll like no slow train
I hang my old hat in a new place
But it won't hang too long
Call me right or call me wrong
That's just my thing
I'm the reason they make fast lanes

I'm the reason they make fast lanes
My soul don't roll like no slow train
I hang my old hat in a new place
But it won't hang too long
Call me right or call me wrong
That's just my thing
I'm the reason they make fast lanes''''''''''''''''
