It's five o'clock, so we're drinking again
Wearing flip flops, so we're drinking again
There's a jukebox, so we're drinking again
We're all drinking again
The sun's out, so we're drinking again
Somebody bought a round, so we're drinking again
But we're all here and we got cold beer
And we're all drinking again

We'll be laughing and lovin', high fivin' and huggin'
Pop top and long neck and honky tonk friends
We're all drinking again

The bartender's pretty so we're drinking again
Thinking kinda dirty so we're drinking again
It's past beer 30, so we're drinking again
We're all drinking again
Just got paid, so we're drinking again
Here comes the shot tray, so we're drinking again
Got a ride home and the bar ain't closed
So we're all drinking again

We'll be laughing and lovin', high fivin' and huggin'
Pop top and long neck and honky tonk friends
We're all drinking again

Our team's playing, so we're drinking again
Cars are racin', so we're drinking again
I guess we're staying, so were drinking again
We're all drinking again
It's two for one, so were drinking again
It sure is fun, so were drinking again
The girls are friendly and this one's empty
So wer'e all drinking again

We'll be laughing and lovin', high fivin' and huggin'
Pop top and long neck and honky tonk friends
We're all drinking again
Yeah, we're all drinking again
How 'bout another one? We're all drinking again

Nobody wants to leave
Somebody put it on my card
Declined? Alright, here's another
Alright
How'd we wind up here?
Who brought us here?
Same time, same place tomorrow''''''''''''''''''
