Love is hard, hard to find, hard to handle
And to give up when you know that it feels right
Yeah love is hard, hard to live with, hard to deny
Or understand when you're lonely late at night

You can blame it on the whiskey
You can blame it on the money
You can blame it on fate or time or the fact that she ain't funny
You can blame it on her mama, on her daddy or her brother
But the fact is, bottom line, simple basic truth

Love is hard to believe in, hard to predict
To forget if you've ever seen it once
Yeah love is hard, hard to hold onto, hard to let go
Or tear down when you build one strong as steel

You can blame it on the whiskey
You can blame it on the money
You can blame it on fate or time or the fact that she ain't funny
You can blame it on her mama, on her daddy or her brother
But the fact is, bottom line, simple basic truth
Love is hard

Love is hard, hard to forgive
Hard to take another chance
When the last one didn't last
Yeah love is hard, hard everyday
Hard to spread like cold peanut butter on a slice of fresh white bread

You can blame it on the whiskey
You can blame it on the money 
You can blame it on fate or time or the fact that she ain't funny
You can blame it on her mama, on her daddy or her brother
But the fact is, bottom line, simple basic truth
Love is hard
Love is hard
Oh it's so hard''''''''''''''''
