Girl, I swear you got me acting crazy
Half the time I don't what my name is
I'm the kind that likes to take it slow and lazy
Girl you got me running hot and hazy

Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never loved before

Boy, you got me burning like a rocket
You stole my heart and stuck it in your pocket
Now I got your face inside my locket
I really tried but I don't think I can stop it

Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never loved before

You sat beside my last night on the sofa
I took your hand and pulled you a little closer
You kissed my lips then let me hold you
That feels the way love is suppose to, baby

Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never loved before

You held the door when we went to the movies
I like your quirky sneaky sense of humor
You're strong and sweet in all the things I needed
You're the one who keeps my heart a beating, baby

Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never loved before

Oh, my heart stops beating
When it's time for you to leave me
Ya, my head starts spinning
Every time that you are near me

Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never loved before

Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never loved before''''''''''''''''''
