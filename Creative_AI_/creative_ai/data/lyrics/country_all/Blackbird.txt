Blackbird singin' in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waitin' for this moment to arrive

Blackbird singin' in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see, yeah
All your life
You were only waitin' for this moment to be free

Blackbird, fly
Blackbird, fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Night, night, night

Blackbird singin' in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waitin' for this moment to arrive
You were only waitin' for this moment to arrive
You were only waitin' for this moment to arrive

Blackbird, fly
Blackbird, fly
Blackbird, fly
Blackbird, fly
Into the light of the dark black

You were only waitin' for this moment to arrive
You were only waitin' for this moment to arrive
You were only waitin' for this moment to arrive''''''''''''''''''
