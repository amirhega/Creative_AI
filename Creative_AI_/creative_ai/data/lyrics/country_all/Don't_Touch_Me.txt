Your hand is like a torch each time you touch me
The look in your eye pulls me apart

Don't open the door to Heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart

Your kiss is like a drink when I'm thirsty
Oh and I'm thirsty for you with all my heart

But don't love me then act as though we never kissed
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart

Don't give me something that you might take away
To have you then loose you wouldn't be smart on my part

Don't open the door to Heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart

Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart''''''''''''''''''''''''
