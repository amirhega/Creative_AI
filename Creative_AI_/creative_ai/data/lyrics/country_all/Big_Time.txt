My hair might be a little too long for your taste, my friend
My car might cost a little less than that suit you're wearing
I'm glad you've stumbled in here on your business trip
Before you close your tab remember I play for tips
Well I bet your wife is beautiful and you're a really big so-and-so
Well I'm not doing bad myself, hey friend don't you know

I play guitar and I sing my songs in the sunshine
Captain and Cokes and barroom jokes keep me feeling fine
And there's always a stage and a beautiful babe to squeeze my lime
In a simple way, I guess you can say I'm living in the big time

I know I'll probably never make a million bucks
But savings accounts and the IRS never worry me much
I don't need that stuff 'cause I've got friends like you
To buy me drinks, have boats and planes that I can use
I know you're really ling in that house up on a hill
So if you feel like giving, friend I've got a jar to fill

I play guitar and I sing my songs in the sunshine
Captain and Cokes and barroom jokes keep me feeling fine
And there's always a stage and a beautiful babe to squeeze my lime
In a simple way, I guess you can say I'm living in the big time

I'm having the time of my life
Not worries on my mind
Everything's just fine
Today is even better than yesterday
Everything is going my way
I'm living in the big time 
And there's always a stage and a beautiful babe to squeeze my lime
In my simple way guess you could say I'm living in the big time''''''&''&''&''&''''''
