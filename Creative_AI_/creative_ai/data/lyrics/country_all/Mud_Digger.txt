All the hoes coughin'
Truck exhaust poppin'

Our tires stay roarin'
While we ridin' through the town

And I keep a bad truck around
Big truck tall suspension

Pipes louder than glass packs,

Been in the mud 5 minutes
And I just stained my damn shirt

Watchin' out for mud diggers
In the country
People gettin' stuck on Friday
All the way through Sunday
It doesn't matter if they comin'
Or they goin'
I bet we make the chafin'
Boys stuck if they come our way
Cops lookin' for the mud trail
From the high way
We slidin' off the trail
Through the road goin' sideways
If they ask
It doesn't matter what they say
