If you're worryin' over me like I've worried over you
Don't do it darlin', don't do it darlin'
If you think I'm missin' you and I'm missin' kissin' you
Don't do it darlin', don't do it darlin'

I gave my heart to you my dear and trusted you and then
You took my heart and played with it and now you say we're through
If you think I'm all alone and you feel the urge to phone
Don't do it darlin', don't do it darlin'

If you're worryin' over me like I've worried over you
Don't do it darlin', don't do it darlin'
If you think I'm missin' you and I'm missin' kissin' you
Don't do it darlin', don't do it darlin'

I gave my heart to you my love, I trusted it with you
You took my heart you played with it and now you say we're through
Now that you are all alone and you feel the urge to phone
Don't do it darlin', don't do it darlin'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
