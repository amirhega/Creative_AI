Better pack up your suitcase and leave in a hurry 
Now I don't wanna show you the door
Since the day that we met you've been nothin' but trouble
Now I don't want you here anymore

Run along run along don't pester me further
For I know that you'll never be true
If you can't treat me right then get out of my life
Go and leave me alone with the blues

Oh you stayed by my side till you got all my money
Now my clothes are all ragged and torn
Since the day that we met you've been nothin' but worry
Lord I wish I had never been born

Run along run along don't you pester me further
I know that you'll never be true
If you can't treat me right then get out of my life
Go and leave me alone with these blues

You may ramble and ramble this whole wide world over 
But don't trust any woman you meet
They won't leave you alone till they've got your last dollar
Then you're just like the dirt beneath their feet

Run along run along don't you pester me further
For I know that you'll never be true
If you can't treat me right then get out of my life
Go and leave me alone with these blues''''''''''''''''''
