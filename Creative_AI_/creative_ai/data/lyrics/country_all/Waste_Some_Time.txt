I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin' right
I ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
Cause since I met you, all I wanna do is
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time

Now I'm a three hundred pound red neck rebel
I'm a God-fearing man, who's had to dance with devil
The Lord I pray my soul to take
If I should ever die before I wake
But see, right now I just wanna love and live
And show this country girl what I got to give
My whole heap and hep of country fun,
Full of four wheel drive, dirt road and shotgun
Ain't nothing better than being out in the woods
With Nic and Nappy Roots and blazin' that good good
Lord I'ma tell You we're doin' it just right
Got my Playboy bunny right by my side
This is me and my girl and ol' Sick Em Sam
In a flatbed Ford off the Copperhead Dam
Listen to Jennings sing that lonesome song
It's all just right, y'all can keep the wrong.

I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin' right
I ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
Since I met you, all I wanna do is
Waste some time

With my feet up, lawn chair beat up
I'm on my third six pack, player can you keep up?
Got it right deep in the sticks, wanna see us?
Front yard golf field bought em, wanna tee up?
Cataracts here tell Jenny go re-up
Bulldog been every truck throw a G up
Hospital, school and the church one street up
Talk more proper when the city folks greet us
Tired of goin' to jail so I learned how to chill
Me and the lil lady have a ball every Chri
Friends and a keg and the country boy meal
I should write a menu how a country boy live
Luck no love, or bucks no buck
Someone hand me a ball and a truck-boat-truck.
I've never been rich but I really don't want much,
Just a roof and some good liquor in my cup.

I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin' right
I ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
Cause since I met you, all I wanna do is
Waste some time

I got five on the wood, twenty on the keg
I been left the hood, yep I did what I said
Momma I'm good 'bout as cool as they come
We cooked a whole hog and love chicken where I'm from
I used to be the bomb, now to think I'm fresh
Still rock my same jeans and keep the liquor to myself
Got a little wealth so I gotta thank the Lord,
Couldn't do it by myself, got some help from Colt Ford
Now we in a Ford, and we travel on a gravel road
He said he knew a spot, where the music and the liquor flow
And of course I'm down like four flats
Drove a country mile, took a left to be exact
Led us smack dab in the middle of the sticks
Now I had seen a lot of things, but nothing like this
A bunch of pretty women, nothin' less than a dime
Colt Ford and Nappy Roots so you know we gonna waste some time

I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin' right
I ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
Cause since I met you, all I wanna do is
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time''''''''''''''''''
