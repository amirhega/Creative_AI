Well you never liked them much
But I broke out these old boots again
Gonna jump in that old truck
Head down to the bar and hang out with an old friend
Been a while since I fired up a cigarette
And got drunk on some draft beer
Well where I'm going tonight
There's a good chance you won't want me back here
I tried to be what you were looking for
But I can't do that anymore

I'm better at being at who I am
Better at letting my rebel run
And nothing about me worth a damn
If I can't be my old man's son
Your world and mine are worlds apart
This 'square peg, round hole' thing's too hard
Being something that ain't never had a chance
I'm better at being who I am

I wasn't ever gonna change
I don't know who in the hell I thought I was kiddin'
For a little while there it seemed like the sex would make it all alright but it didn't
This ain't my side of the tracks
I got good at forgetting that

I'm better at being who I am
Better at letting my rebel run
Ain't nothing about me worth a damn
If I can't be my old man's son
Your world and mine are worlds apart
This 'square peg, round hole' thing's too hard
Being something I ain't never had a chance
I'm better at being back on my side of town
Back down to earth
A blue jean boy and a flannel shirt
I'm just not what you deserve
For what it's worth, for what it's worth

I'm better at being at who I am
Better at letting my rebel run
And nothing about me is worth a damn
If I can't be my old man's son
Your world and mine are worlds apart
This 'square peg, round hole' thing's too hard
Being something I ain't never had a chance
I'm better at being who I am''''''''''''''''''
