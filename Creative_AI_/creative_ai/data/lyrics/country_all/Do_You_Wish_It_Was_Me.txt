Do you wish it was me?
When the sun slowly chases the moon from the sky
And touches your face as you open your eyes
What are you thinking? Do you like what you see?
Is it all that you dreamed of or do you wish it was me?

Is the life that you chosen free from regret?
Or is what my mind invisions to hard to forget?
Has the glitter all faded? Do you get what you need?
Are you satisfied baby or do you wish it was me?

I know you did what you thought you should do
It was safe and secure so completely thought through
You sacrificed passion and abandoned your dreams


Baby, was it all worth it or do you wish it was me?

Is it closer to the verse or the last?
Is the fire still raging or has it burned down to ash?
Do the memories still haunt you? Do they beg and pled?
Are you satisfied baby or do you wish it was me?

Is the life that you chosen free from regrets?
Or is what my mind in visions to hard to forget?
Has the glitter all faded? Do you get what you need?
Are you satisfied baby or do you wish it was me?
Are you satisfied baby? mm... yeah
Or Do you wish it was me?
Oh, Do you wish it was me?''''''''''''''''''
