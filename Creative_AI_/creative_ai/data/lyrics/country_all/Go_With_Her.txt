Yeah daddy said son I'm sorry
You and Sheila ain't getting along
And if she's so dead set on leaving you boy
Why ain't she already gone
Yeah you better break out some sweet talking
Because I promise you you're gonna miss her
And I know what I'd do if my baby left me
Pack up my things and go with her

You don't stay with the one you can't live with
It's the one you can't live without
It's the one that's got you tore up in pieces, boy
It's the one you keep talking about
Prides a tough pill to swallow
It'll leave you lonely and cold and bitter
So what you need to do if she's gonna leave you
You better pack up and go with her

Daddy said son I'm through preaching
I've said all I'm gonna say
Now if you love her as much as I think you do
You're a fool if she gets away
She can go anywhere that she wants to
Don't give up, no don't quit her
Do like I did when your momma left me
Hell, I just packed up and went with her

You don't stay with the one you can't live with
It's the one you can't live without
It's the one that's got you tore up in pieces, boy
It's the one you keep fretting about
Prides a tough pill to swallow
It'll leave you lonely and cold and bitter
So what you need to do if she's gonna leave you
You better pack up and go with her

You don't stay with the one you can't live with
It's the one you can't live without
It's the one that's got you tore up in pieces, boy
It's the one you keep crying about
Prides a tough pill to swallow
It'll leave you lonely and cold and bitter
So what you need to do if she's gonna leave you
You better pack up and go with her

Yeah I know what I did when my baby left me
I packed up my things and went with her''''''''''''''''''
