This big white redneck's got the blues
From this cowboy hat to these worn out boots
A woman done lit my fuse
And this bar ain't got the booze
To cure this big white redneck with the blues

Lord I tried the best I could
I never really thought she would
Leave me for younger fella
Didn't take the time to tell her
'Bout all the good things she done
And how she was my only one
True love, best friend, huntin' buddy gettin' muddy
She was everything to me
Guess I just couldn't see
What it was she was missin'
Slow dancin' and long kissin'
Dinner on a Friday night
Wine by the candle light
Now I'm just sittin' here
Cryin' in my beer

This big white redneck's got the blues
From this cowboy hat to these worn out boots
A woman done lit my fuse
And this bar ain't got the booze
To cure this big white redneck with the blues

Now I'm layin' drunk in the floor
Yellin' lookin' at the door
I called her mama and her sister
Told 'em that I really missed her
I guess I know what kinda gone
She ain't never comin' home
Back to bein' all alone
My life is like a sad song
Every time I hear her name
I realize what a shame
Now I'm just old news
Dealin' with these danged ole blues

This big white redneck's got the blues
Lord o' mercy this pain really hurts me y'all
From this cowboy hat to these worn out boots
I don't know what to do
I'm never gettin' over you
A woman done lit my fuse
And this bar ain't got the booze (That's right)
To cure this big white redneck with the blues

Yeah this woman done lit my fuse
And this bar ain't got the booze (That's right)
To cure this big white redneck with the blues
Well we're gonna see if it'll cure me
Matter of fact I'm cured now
I'm gonna call your sister
I might even call your mama
That's right
What's that number''''''''''''''''''
