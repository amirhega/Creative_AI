You got me all caught up
The way you look tonight
We could head downtown
Or I can turn around, up here, on the right
Ah, just look at this sky
The rain ain't far from fallin' down
And I wanna get to know you
Better than I know this little town, yes I do

I wanna feel your heart go tic-toc
While the rain from your hair drip-drops
Parked out in the middle of nowhere

There's a place I can get up against your lips
That's where I gotta be with you lookin' like this
Let's get lost somewhere
Anywhere we ain't gotta hold back
If we're gonna go out, baby
Let's go out like that

And I'll grab your door
You can take my hand
Hop up on my shoulders and I'll walk us over
Where we can dance
And I'll leave the headlights on
So, I can see your face
Spin you 'round in the mud
Yeah, soak it all up, baby
What'cha say, what'cha say

I wanna feel your heart go tic-toc
While the rain from your hair drip-drops
Girl, I'm talkin' country kinda crazy, yeah

Out where I can get up against your lips
That's where I gotta be with you lookin' like this
Let's get lost somewhere
Anywhere we ain't gotta hold back
If we're gonna go out, baby
Let's go out like that

Yeah, I wanna feel your heart go tic-toc
While the rain from your hair drip-drops
Gettin' country kinda crazy in the middle of nowhere

Out where I can get up against your lips
That's where I gotta be with you lookin' like this
Let's get lost somewhere
Anywhere we ain't gotta hold back
If we're gonna go out, baby
Let's go out, baby

If we're gonna go out, baby
Let's go out like that

Yeah girl, that's where it's at
Let's go out like that''''''''''''''''''
