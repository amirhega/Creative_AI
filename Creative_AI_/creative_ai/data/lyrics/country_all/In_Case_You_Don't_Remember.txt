In case you don't remember
I left a picture of us on the hood of your truck from that spring break
We were young and a little bit crazy enough to just think
We were gonna be something
Yeah weren't we something
A little bit burned a little bit buzzed didn't feel it
Still got the hat that you wore flip back I wear it
Yeah I swear it

There was magic in the air it was everywhere that we touched down
The carnival ride and the high we were on as it went around
It was us against the world and you swore girl that we'd never surrender
But I still can't forget you girl
In case you don't remember

I still got the key to the room that we never slept in
Yeah the love we made you let it fade away well I kept it
And I don't regret it

There was magic in the air it was everywhere that we touched down
The carnival ride and the high we were on as it went around
It was us against the world and you swore girl that we'd never surrender
But I still can't forget you girl
In case you don't remember

The last time we kissed
The taste of my lips
The way we couldn't say goodbye

There was magic in the air it was everywhere that we touched down
The carnival ride and the high we were on as it went around
There was something in the way that you swore girl
That we'd never surrender but I still can't forget you girl
No I won't ever forget you girl
In case you don't remember

I left a picture of us on the hood of your truck from that spring break''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
