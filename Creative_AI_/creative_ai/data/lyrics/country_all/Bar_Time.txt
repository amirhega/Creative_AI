My wife's a good woman but she never shuts up
Counting my drinks till I'm fed up
She's got a list of chores she want me to do
I'm turning off the cell, baby I'm through
Dam, I need to get out of that house

Well I'm a son, husband and father
And I guess I've been a good provider
But a man needs his bar time
The sound of the juke box is really fine
Its bar time, yeah

I love my mom but she needs me to watch her
Pick up her drugs and take her to the doctor
Take her to the seniors early bird
Go to church and talk hear gods word
Dam I need to get out of that house

Well I'm a son, husband and father
And I guess I've been a good provider

No more PMS, sickness or hot flashes
No real women with their constant clashes
Its bar time, yeah

Yeah, my daughter she's a real honey
A single mom who always needs money
She always wants me to mind her brat
Man I'm so tired of that screaming rug rat

Well I guess I'm a pretty good fellow
But when I really need to get mellow
I say honey I'm off to the shop
She don't know it's a lounge called lollipop
Well a man needs to have his bar space
Where nobody is ever on his case
Pretty bartenders never nag at me
And the meaningless talk is all for free
Its bar time yeah, yeah''''''''''''''''
