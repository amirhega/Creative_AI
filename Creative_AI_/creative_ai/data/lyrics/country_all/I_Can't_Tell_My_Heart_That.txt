I can't tell my heart, that you are no good
I'd give this world, if only I could
You cheated and lied and you left me flat
I know it's true, but I can't tell my heart that

Oh my foolish heart, why won't you believe
That some one is gone, it's no use to grieve
Still pining for some one, who will never come back
I know it's true, but I can't tell my heart that

I can't tell my heart, that you are no good
I'd give this world, if only I could
You cheated and lied, and you left me flat
Yes it's true but I can't tell my heart that

My heart still cries out, it wasn't long ago
That we were together, you said you loved me so
Somewhere out there, it don't matter where at
To you I'm forgotten, but I can't tell my heart that

I can't tell my heart, that you are no good
I'd give this world, if only I could
You cheated and lied, and you left me flat
Yes it's true, but I can't tell my heart that'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
