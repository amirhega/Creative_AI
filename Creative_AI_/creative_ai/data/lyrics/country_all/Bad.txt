When you're good, girl you're good
Doing every little thing exactly like you should
So sweet, with your angel eyes just killin' me
On the porch, blue sky
Yeah you hold my hand say you want to take a Sunday drive
It's all good, when you're good

But when you're bad
And you're lookin' at me just like that
Reach up and you take my hat and you turn it around
Steal my drink and you shoot it on down
When you're wild, child, flashin' that come here smile
Spinnin' in your little red dress
Show a little too much
When you dance like that
Sayin' look don't touch
I never know what I'll get when we get together
When you're good, you're good
But when you're bad, you're better

When you're good, girl you're good
When you're countin' the stars in the sky layin' back
On the hood, talkin' 'bout
How you want to stay here 'til the moon goes out
With your head, on my chest
One innocent little kiss
Aw it's so good, so good, when you're good

When you're bad
And you're lookin' at me just like that
Reach up and you take my hat and you turn it around
Steal my drink and you shoot it on down
When you're wild, child, flashin' that come here smile
Spinnin' in your little red dress
Show a little too much
When you dance like that
Sayin' look don't touch
I never know what I'll get when we get together
When you're good, you're good
But when you're bad, you're better

Yeah I love every side of you
All the wrong and the right of you
All the day and the nighttime too
But you're the best I've ever had

When you're bad
And you're lookin' at me just like that
Reach up and you take my hat and you turn it around
Steal my drink and you shoot it on down
When you're wild, child, flashin' that come here smile
Spinnin' in your little red dress
Show a little too much
When you dance like that
Sayin' look don't touch
I never know what I'll get when we get together
When you're good, you're good
But when you're bad, you're better
Girl when you're bad you're better'''''''''''''''''''''''
