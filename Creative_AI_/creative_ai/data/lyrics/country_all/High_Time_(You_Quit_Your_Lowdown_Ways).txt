Well, I'm sick and tired of waking up sick and tired
As of today there's gonna be some changes made
Well, you might as well keep your feet on the ground
'Cause I won't stand still for your moving around
It's high time you quit your lowdown way

Any talk to talk I hear over town
Is it really true, girl, that you just wanna jump up and down
Well, the word as well as I can recall
Everywhere you've been you've been the belle of the ball
It's high time you quit your lowdown way

I remember one time now way back down on the farm
My daddy had a dominiker hen but she wouldn't stay home
Then she can fly as high as a jet airplane
Not after daddy cut the little ol' wing
It's high time you quit your lowdown ways

Man, I'm sick and tired of waking up sick and tired
As of today there's gonna be some changes made
Well, you might as well keep your feet on the ground
Girl, I won't stand still for your moving around
It's high time you quit your lowdown way

Honey, it's high time you quit your lowdown way
I'll try''''''''''''''''''''
