You don't know why, you can't make it stop
You were hooked with your daddy's hand-me-down flat top
The first time that you made your first love cry
And the words you wrote were running from her eyes
Down on the paper, made you feel so alive
So you packed up your pickup and crossed that Tennessee line

You're always searching for a little something different to say
And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told you don't belong
You drink too much in a smokey little bar downtown
Stumble home when it's time to throw in the towel
Wake up in the morning, look out, and the sunlight hurts
Find your old guitar, write down another verse
In the land of a million songs

Everybody's got a story that needs to be sold
And they pray someday they'll hang a little gold
And ride back to their hometown with their head held high
On any given day, there's a dream, there's a chance
That lightning will strike at the end of a pen
And all the leaving, and losing, will all be worth the fight

So you're always searching for a little something different to say
And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told you don't belong
You take that loan dot job just to pay the rent
You learn a few things from them hard-working men
You listen to 'em laugh and you listen to 'em curse
You find your old guitar and write down another verse
In the land of a million songs

Some will come and some will go
If you don't lay it all out there, you'll never know

You're always searching for a little something different to say
And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told, boy, you don't belong
You drink too much in a smokey little bar downtown
Stumble home when it's time to throw in the towel
Wake up in the morning, look out, and the sunlight hurts
You find that old guitar and write down another verse
In the land of a million songs
In the land of a million songs''''''''''''''''''
