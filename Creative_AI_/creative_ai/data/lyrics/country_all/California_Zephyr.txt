From the Great Salt Lakes of Utah to California's golden shore
Colorado and Nevada through the deserts burnin' door
While she's circlin' through the canyons, can't you see that mountain stream
It's the California Zephyr, the Union Pacific Queen

See her rockin' see her rollin' as she rambles on her way
She left LA this mornin' burnin' up the right of way
In the distance hear her moanin' hear her lonesome whistle scream
It's the California Zephyr, the Union Pacific Queen

She leaves the city of the angels headin' for ole Santa Fe
She's a makin' nauts she's makin' time just watch her swing and sway
And from way out in the darkness, see that headlight gleam
It's the California Zephyr, the Union Pacific Queen

From the Great Salt Lakes of Utah to California's golden shore
Colorado and Nevada through the deserts burnin' door
While she's circlin' through the canyons, can't you see that mountain stream
It's the California Zephyr, the Union Pacific Queen''''''''''''''''''
