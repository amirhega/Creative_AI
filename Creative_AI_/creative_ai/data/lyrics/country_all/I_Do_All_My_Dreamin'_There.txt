You know I got me a spot somewhere
Come on

There's a little place down an overgrown road
Nobody but me in the whole world knows
Been going there ever since I was a kid
On my red dirt bike with my blue tick Sid

Spend a lot of long summer nights
With the hoot owls and the satellites
Ain't the kind of place that I ever shared
But come on with me, and let me take you where

I do my bobber-sinking
Peanut-butter-sandwich-eatin'
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer-crackin'
Crying, praying, laughin'
Just talking to the man in the sky

Baby, jump on in
There's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut-offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
With the summer sweet jasmine in the air?
I do all my dreamin' there!

There's a big oak on the other side
Where I took my grandpa's pocket knife
And I carved their names with tears in my eyes
When he joined grandma in the by and by

Got it right here in the dashboard box
Tip broke off and the blade don't lock
But I bet it'd carve our names just fine
If you wanna come along with me next time

I do my bobber-sinking
Peanut-butter-sandwich-eatin'
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer-crackin'
Crying, praying, laughin'
Just talking to the man in the sky

Baby, jump on in
There's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut-offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
With the summer sweet jasmine in the air?
I do all my dreamin' there!

Yeah, I've done some bobber-sinking
Peanut-butter-sandwich-eatin'
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer-crackin'
Crying, praying, laughin'
Just talking to the big man in the sky

Baby, jump on in,
There's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut-offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
With the summer sweet jasmine in the air?
I do all my dreamin' there!

Right there, ha ha ha!''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
