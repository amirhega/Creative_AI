I know this town like the back of my hand
Every back road, every turn road
Baby, where you wanna go?
Get you there with my eyes closed
Just pick the spot, say the word
Baby, what you got?
It might be my Chevrolet, but tonight, you're calling the shots

We can go uptown, show out
Spend every dime in my pocket
We can hit the outskirts, red dirt
Riding these roads like a rocket
You can be my freeway DJ
Just tell me where to point these lights
Yeah, I might be the one behind the wheel
But you're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight

Been waiting all day just to see what you got on
Is it your high heels, your blue jeans?
Maybe that red dress, or climbing up in your bare feet
I'll put the pedal down, but baby, you got the keys

We can go uptown, show out
Spend every dime in my pocket
We can hit the outskirts, red dirt
Riding these roads like a rocket
You can be my freeway DJ
Just tell me where to point these lights
Yeah, I might be the one behind the wheel
But you're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight

Just pick a spot, just say the word
Baby, what you got?
It might be my Chevrolet, but tonight, you're calling the shots

We can go uptown, show out
Spend every dime in my pocket
We can hit the outskirts, red dirt
Riding these roads like a rocket
You can be my freeway DJ
Just tell me where to point these lights
Yeah, I might be the one behind the wheel
But you're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight

You're driving this thing tonight
Just pick a spot, just say the word
Baby, what you got?
It might be my Chevrolet, but tonight, you're calling the shots''''''''''''''''''
