Winter gettin' colder, summer gettin' warmer
Tidal wave comin' cross the Mexican border
Why buy a gallon, its cheaper by the barrel
Just don't get busted singin' Christmas carols

That's us, That's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burnin
Funny how the world keeps turnin'
Look ma, no hands
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride

Momma gets her box off watchin Desperate Housewives
Daddy works his can off payin' for the good life
Kids on the YouTube learnin how to be cool
Livin' in a cruel world, pays to be a mean girl

That's us, That's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burnin
Funny how the world keeps turnin'
Look ma, no hands
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride

Poor little miss, Americas town
She gained five pounds and lost her crown
Quick fix plastic surgical antidote
Got herself a record deal, can't even sing a note

Plasma getting bigger, Jesus getting smaller
Spill a cup of coffee, make a million dollars
Customs caught a thug with an aerosol can
If the shoe don't fit, the fit's gonna hit the shan

That's us, That's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burnin
Funny how the world keeps turnin'
Hot dog, Hot damn
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride
Oh yeah,''''''''''''''''
