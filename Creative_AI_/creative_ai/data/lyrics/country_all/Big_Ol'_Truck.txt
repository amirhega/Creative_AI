Yeah you can see the girl comin' 
From a mile away 
She got her big wheels turnin' 
She's got Oklahoma plates 

She's got her sun roof up 
She's got her window rolled down 
And you oughta feel the ground shakin' 
When she comes to town 
 
Yeah I'm in love with the girl and her four-wheel drive 
Chrome steel bumpers and red step sides 
She has a large time in her large machine 
Man I wonder how she gets up in that thing 
It casts a big shadow sittin' in the sun 
She's got it revved up rockin' ready to run 
And someday soon I'm gonna climb right up 
And take a little ride in her big ol' truck 

She's got bucket seats fully customized 
'In Your Wildest Dreams' painted on the side 
It was built to run, she was built to show 
She's got a Haggard hit playin' on her stereo 

Yeah I'm in love with the girl and her four-wheel drive 
Chrome steel bumpers and red step sides 
She has a large time in her large machine 
Man I wonder how she gets up in that thing 
It casts a big shadow sittin' in the sun 
She's got it revved up rockin' ready to run 
And someday soon I'm gonna climb right up 
And take a little ride in her big ol' truck 

Yeah I'm in love with the girl and her four-wheel drive

She's got it revved up rockin' ready to run

Big ol' truck 
Ten feet tall ten feet wide 
It's a big ol' truck 
Here she come again man'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
