How many Americans do we have in here tonight?
*Crowd cheers*

In the days following September 11th last year everybody that was a poet or a writer or a song writer of any kind Had a reason to write some words down or thoughts down on a piece of paper and I was no different that's what you do when I do
And my father served in the army in the 50s
He lost his right eye in a training combat mission
He came home
He put a flag up on the farm I was raised on
I lost him six months prior to the attacks on New York City and The United States and that flag that flew out in that yard it's flown there everyday
He raised me right and he never bitched one time about loseing his eye
I never heard him cry about it one time
He was glad to go do it and that's why we're free today and it's our turn to stand on what our fathers and forefathers did for us and make sure we don't let'em down

I wrote a song in the following days after September 11th it's called The Angry American and I wanna send this out to my father tonight''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
