I was sad and blue, I was down hearted, too
It seemed like the whole world was lost
And I took a chance and we happened to dance
To the tune of the Alabama Waltz

Waltz, waltz, the Alabama Waltz
There all my fears and cares were lost
There in your arms, with all of your charms
We danced to the Alabama Waltz''''''''''''''''
