Well I got a girlfriend, her name is Maria
Sexy, spicy hot senorita
She like to two-step, she like to mambo
Heats it up like a Texas jalapeno
Whoo
Jalapeno Man

Well I get so hot every time I kiss her
Spin me around like an Amarillo twister
So I take her fore a ride in my El Camino
You know I like my ladies hot - like Jalapeno
Whoo
Jalapeno brother
Whoo
Say everybody wanna heat it up, wanna eat it up
Wanna sing along with me, Big and Rich is where the party be
Say everybody wanna heat it up, wanna eat it up
Wanna sing along with me Big and Rich is where the party, where the party be!
Well my baby lets the tequila do the talkin'
Long as she knows that everybody's watchin
Shakin' that thing like a wild bandito
You know she burns the whole place up like jalapeno
Whoo
