You've told me 'bout your family
The town that you grew up in
Believe me, I wanna know everything about you
And I've rambled on about me
By now you know I'm crazy
We could go on all night if we wanted to
But I don't want to

I don't wanna talk anymore
I know enough about you to know all I wanna do is
Find out a little bit more
I don't wanna waste that moon
And the heat on the hood of this Ford
I don't wanna talk anymore

That homemade wine on your lips
My name under your breath
Under one of the best river nights you ever saw
Hey, that says it all

I don't wanna talk anymore
I know enough about you to know all I wanna do is
Find out a little bit more
I don't wanna waste that moon
And the heat on the hood of this Ford
I don't wanna talk anymore

I don't wanna talk
I don't wanna talk anymore
I know enough about you to know all I wanna do is
Find out a little bit more
I don't wanna waste that moon
And the heat on the hood of this Ford
I don't wanna talk anymore
I don't wanna talk anymore''''''''''''''''''
