Just what I had in mind, thinking 'bout the weekend
Standing by the yeti with the party lights plugged in
Got a jug of feel good going around
There's just one thing missing baby right about now

I need a sweet little something like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little something like you

I see you dancing over there with your girlfriends
Got your fine self showing off that sun tan
You keep smiling that smile at me
Like you're reading my mind and you know

I need a sweet little something like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little something like you

I need a sweet little something like you girl
Sliding into my world
Yeah, I've been needing it all night
Slow county just right, honey suckle sweet little something

I need a sweet little something like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little something

Sweet little something like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little something like you

Ride you around in my old truck
Keep you out until the sun comes up
Girl you got that serious
Sweet little something like you
The way you fly yeah across that seat
Looking so damn good to me
Hey little girl right now
I need a sweet little something like you

Ride you around in my old truck
Keep you out until the sun comes up
Girl you got that serious
Sweet little something like you
The way you fly yeah across that seat
Looking so damn good to me
Hey little girl right now
I need a sweet little something like you'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
