I'll be the bad guy, I'll take the black eye
When I walk out you can slam the door
I'll be the S.O.B. if that's what you need from me
So you don't have to love me anymore

When you and our friends talk, make it all my fault
Tell 'em I'm rotten to the core
I'll let it all slide, get 'em all on your side
So you don't have to love me anymore

I will keep all those memories of the good times
Yeah there were some good times
So when you think of you and me
They won't even cross your mind

If the wine you're drinkin', leads you to thinkin'
That you want what we had before
Girl you can call me, I'll let it ring and ring
So you don't have to love me anymore

Yeah I will keep all those memories of the good times
Yeah there were some good times
So when you think of you and me
They won't even cross your mind

If you need me to make you cry
I don't want to but I'll try
So you don't have to love me anymore'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
