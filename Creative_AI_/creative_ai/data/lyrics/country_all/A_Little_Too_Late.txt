It's a little too late, I'm a little too gone;
A little too tired of this hangin' on:
So I'm lettin' go while I'm still strong enough to.
It's got a little too sad, I'm a little too blue;
It's a little too bad you were too good to be true.
I'm big-time over you baby: it's a little too late.

No, I don't wanna talk about,
What we can do about us any more.
Only time you would be wastin',
Is the time it takes to walk right out that door.
Yeah, talk about water under the bridge:
You should know by now, girl, that's all this is.

It's a little too late, I'm a little too gone;
A little too tired of just hangin' on:
I'm lettin' go while I'm still strong enough to.
It's got a little too sad, I'm a little too blue;
It's a little too bad you were too good to be true.
I'm big-time over you baby: it's a little too late.

There was a time this heart of mine,
Would take you back every time, don't you know?
But that's been two packs of cigarettes,
A sleepless night, a nervous wreck, a day ago.
Now you ain't got no business comin' around.
I'm closin' up shop: shuttin' us down.

It's a little too late, I'm a little too gone;
I'm a little too tired of just hangin' on:
So I'm lettin' go while I'm still strong enough to.
It's got a little too sad, I'm a little too blue;
It's a little too bad you were too good to be true.
I'm big-time over you baby: it's a little too late.
I'm big-time over you baby: it's a little too late.''''''''''''''''
