Sometimes it feels just like you're so far away
We don't take the time to say the thing we used to say
And I can't remember the last time together lost in each other's eyes
And it just ain't right
Come on baby let's leave tonight

I just wanna run, I just want to run away with you
And live wide open
Set 'em on fire, crazy like we used to do
It don't matter where we're going
Up on a mountain, down by the beach side
Till we find the love that we fell into
Hey, I just wanna run, I just want to run away with you
I just want to run away with you

I miss your midnight kiss and loving you all night long
This life's like a rip tide and we're barely hanging on
Caught up in the worry, and always in a hurry and losing what we're all about
Lets slow it down
Take our love and get out of this town

I just wanna run, I just want to run away with you
And live wide open
Set 'em on fire, crazy like we used to do
It don't matter where we're going
Up on a mountain, down by the beach side
Till we find the love that we fell into
Hey, I just wanna run, I just want to run away with you
I just want to run away with you

I want to lay you down with nothing but the sound of my name on your lips
We can let it all go and move real close and find that place again

I just wanna run, I just want to run away with you
And live wide open
Set 'em on fire, crazy like we used to do
It don't matter where we're going
Up on a mountain, down by the beach side
Till we find the love that we fell into
Hey, I just wanna run, I just want to run away with you
I just want to run away with you

I just wanna run away with you
I just wanna run away with you
I just wanna run away with you''''&''&''&''&''''''&''&
