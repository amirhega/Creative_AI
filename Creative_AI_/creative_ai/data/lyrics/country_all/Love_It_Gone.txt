I know, I know it, baby
Sounds like your day's been crazy
I just wanna hold ya
All the weight that's on your shoulders
Anything that's wrong
Let me, let me love it gone
Come on and trust me, honey
I can turn those raindrops sunny
Let me untie that tangle
Put on that kissing angel good morning song
Let me, let me love it gone

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, shake it off your list
Girl, I want, I want
I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone

Why don't you slip into something off the frequent menu
Kick back, let down your hair
Yeah, that one right there looks so good on
Let me, let me love it gone

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, shake it off your list
Girl, I want, I want
I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone
So long

This night looks good on you
Let me love it, let me, let me love it
And every little inch of you
Let me love it, let me, let me love it

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, shake it off your list
Girl, I want, I want
I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone
Baby, let me love it gone

Let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Baby, let me love it gone''''''''''''''''''
