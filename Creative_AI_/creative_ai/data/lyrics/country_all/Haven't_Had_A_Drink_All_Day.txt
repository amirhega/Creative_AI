Oh yeah,
In a ? I was running behind
I had a load on my trailer and a lot on my mind
And I was rocking, rolling cross the USA
I got stoned this morning but I haven't had a drink all day

Pulled into Arizona about a hundred?
When a smokey bear shot me with his radar gun
He said 'you're drunk son'
Yeah there ain't no way
I got stoned this morning but I haven't had a drink all day

This gal pal I found didn't bother a soul
Gave a pretty girl a ride to a watering hole
And she thanked me
And I pulled her off the interstate
She said 'I got stoned this morning but I haven't had a drink all day'

? Amarillo like a wild west wind
Stopped in Oklahoma City just to see an old friend
What's up cous', he said 'I'm OK' yeah
I got stoned this morning but I haven't had a drink all day
Let's drive

Got home to Little Rock about 3am
My baby met me at the door with a bottle in her hand
'Good to see my man, let's celebrate' yeah
I got stoned this morning but I haven't had a drink all day
I got stoned this morning but I haven't had a drink all day
Said I got drunk this morning but I haven't been stoned all day yeah'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
