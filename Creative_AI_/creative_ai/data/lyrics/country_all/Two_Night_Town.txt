I just spent three nights in a two night town
Sun's comin' up and I'm just goin' down
Am I ever gonna turn my life around
I just spend three nights in a two night town

It was women, it was sinnin', it was alcohol
It was everything the Bible says will make a man fall
And I didn't wanna little Lord I wanted it all
It was women, it was sinnin', it was alcohol

When am I, ever gonna learn to walk away
When the chips are down and the cards ain't fallin' my way
Why do I always gotta stay to long till it's too late

I just spend three nights in a two night town
With a bunch of lost souls just tryna get found
Girl, I've been a little crazy since you walked out
So I just spend three nights in a two night town

When am I ever gonna learn to walk away
When the chips are down and the cards ain't fallin' my way?
Why do I always gotta stay to long till it's too late?
I just spend three nights in a two night town

Sun's comin' up and I'm just goin' down
But baby this pain is still hangin around
I think I'll spend four nights in a two night town''''''''''''''''''
