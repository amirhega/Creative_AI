Lately it takes both of us to drive this old Chevy
The way that you keep kissin' me is gettin' hot and heavy
I'll drive a million miles just to walk down the aisle beside you
This feelin' between us is makin' it obvious what we gotta do

Let's find a church
Any one will work
Be it Baptist Methodist Lutheran Episcopalian
How 'bout a country chapel A city tabernacle
As long as we can say I do I'm gonna marry you
And be the luckiest man on this earth
Well I can't wait much longer lets find a church
It may be late but we'll try to wake up

Some ole preacher
And if that don't work we'll settle for a deacon or a Sunday school teacher
We're in a hurry so baby don't worry 'bout no dress
It don't matter if my jeans are tattered
Or if your hair's a mess

Let's find a church
Any one will work
Be it Baptist Methodist Lutheran Presbyterian
How 'bout a country chapel A city tabernacle
As long as we can say I do I'm gonna marry you
And be the luckiest man on this earth
Well I can't wait much longer let's find a church

Let's find a church
Any one will work
Be it Baptist Methodist Lutheran Pentecostal
How 'bout a country chapel A city tabernacle
As long as we can say I'm gonna marry you
And be the luckiest man on this earth
This feelin's gettin' stronger let's find a church
Oh I do'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
