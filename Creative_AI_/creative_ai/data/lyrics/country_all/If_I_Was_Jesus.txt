If I was Jesus
I'd have some real long hair
A robe and some sandals, is exactly what I'd wear
I'd be the guy at the party
Turning water into wine
Me and my disciples
We'd have a real good time

Ooh and I'd lay my life down for you
Yeah, and I'd show you who's the boss
I'd forgive you and adore you
While I was hangin' on your cross

If I was Jesus
I'd have some friends that were poor
I'd run around with the wrong crowd
Man I'd never be bored
Then I'd heal me a blind man
Get myself crucified
By politicians and preachers
Who got something to hide

Ooh and I'd lay my life down for you
Yeah, I'd show you who's the boss
I'd forgive you and adore you
While I was hangin' on your cross
If I was Jesus

If I was Jesus
I'd come back from the dead
And I'd walk on some water
Just to mess with your head
I know your dark little secrets
I'd look you right in the face
And tell you I love you
With amazing grace

Ooh and I'd lay my life down for you
Yeah, I'd show you who's the boss
I'd forgive you and adore you
While I was hangin' on your cross

If I was Jesus
If I was Jesus''''''''''''''''''''
