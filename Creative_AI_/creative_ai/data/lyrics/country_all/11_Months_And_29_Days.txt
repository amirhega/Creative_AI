When I busted in Austin
Walkin' around in a daze
Man, I'm sittin' in the slammer
Lookin' out through the bars 'cross a haze

It'll all clear up
In 11 months and 29 days

Keep that Lone Star cold
The dance floor hot while I'm gone
Keep the Lone Star cold
Dance floor hot while I'm gone
While I'm gone

Keep your hands off my baby
I ain't gonna be gone that long
Incognito bandito

That old judge put a sledgehammer
Put it in my hand when he said
I'm gonna send you down to Huntsville
And I'm gonna shave your face
And I'm gonna shave your head

Doin' 11/29
Cement floor for my bed

When I busted in Austin
Walkin' around in a daze
Now I'm sittin' in this slammer
Lookin' out through the bars 'cross a haze

It'll all clear up
In 11 months and 29 days''''''''''''''''
