I'm thinking 'bout the perfect girl
She gotta have her dirty side
I'm talkin' about four-wheel hoppin' inside my truck with a dirty side
She don't even dust seat off, she sippin' on Yoohoo
Then a kiss on my right cheek that's right, it's what we do
Head out to the field, check them trees there's the food plots.
Put the front back in the trees
Tailgate talk about the birds and bees
Might even put the boat in and do a little crappie fishing
I got the motor trollin', my girl is happy fishing
She can catch 'em skin 'em fry 'em what yaw know about that
Pretty good with a shotgun and bow one for sure about that
All you boys better get you one that can change your world ain't nothing better then a dirty side of country living

All my girls out there put your hands up high
If you ain't scared to show your dirty side

Man I'mma tell you there everywhere
Stop looking at magazines head on out to the county fair
Go look at the Walmart down any aisle at the supermarket
Filed party on a Friday night Pull right up, put in park an
Look around for the dusty boots, tan legs, cherry lips
Smile that'll make Jesus blush faded in to make it on here hips
She can change her own oil it's Rodeos and football games
She plow her own soil warms your soul when she calls your name
She pretty like her mama got a piece of her daddy stuff ain't scarred of a little drama ain't scared of a little mud
'You better go get you one, I guarantee it will blow your mind
Make sure she got a dirty side, you'll understand why I got mine

Still in touch with them back road roots
