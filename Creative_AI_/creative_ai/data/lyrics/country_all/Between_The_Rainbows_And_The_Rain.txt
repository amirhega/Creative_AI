It's good to hear your voice
After all this time
I've been told I'm hard to find
It's rainin' here but I'm keepin' dry
And for me that's doing good
To tell the truth
There ain't much to know
I've dealt some cards and I've dug some holes
But I haven't found that pot of gold
Like I said I would

Between the high lines and the fence posts
The interstate and the dirt roads
No matter how the wind blows
I hear your name
And out of all the things I've done that I regrett
There's only one
I'd like to change
Out here between the rainbows and the rain

I spent last month in Santa Fe
I heard your daddy passed away
I should've called your mama
To say how sorry that I am
No I don't think I'm comin' back
It's been too long and I guess that's that
But it's nice to know that you still
Ask about me now and then''''''''''''''''''
