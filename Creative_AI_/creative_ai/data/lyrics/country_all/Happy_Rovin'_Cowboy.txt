Hear my song as I ride along
I'm a happy rovin' cowboy
Herdin' the dark clouds out of the sky
Keepin' the heavens blue

No where to go nothing to do
I'm a happy rovin' cowboy
Let me ride that long trail down to the end
Where the skies are always blue

I ain't got a dime, I'm just spendin' my time
I'm a happy rovin' cowboy
Let me sing my song till they call me home
To the land beyond the blue'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
