It's Like a bolt of lightning hits me in my chest
Right out of the blue
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
Top of the world I'm standing rocking at my best
Then I look like a fool
Every time I see you
Every time I see you

You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down messing with my mood
I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you
Every time I see you

I wanna tell you everything I ever wanted to say
But I never do
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
I'm sure my steering wheel and dashboard would
Love a good break
But they feel it too
Every time I see you
Why I gotta see you?'''''''''''''''''''''
