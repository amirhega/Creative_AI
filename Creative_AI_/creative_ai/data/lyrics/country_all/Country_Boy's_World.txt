She was raised up in Jersey
I said oh Lord have mercy
Never seen a one light town till she moved down here
She said I'm so bored out of my mind
Need a Starbucks and a wifi
Or a jet airliner to fly me anywhere
I said do you wanna take a drive in my truck
Don't pay no mind to that 12 point buck
Laid across my hood
You ever been to

Rome Georgia
Picked peaches off the trees
Climbed the water tower in Paris Tennessee
Been to Florence Alabama
Drank muscadine wine
Just give me a chance to change your mind
So before you go and fly away girl
Let me show you 'round a country boy's world

Somewhere between there on a dirt road
When I rolled down my window
She smelled the scent of wildflowers on the summer wind
With just a bite of homeade ice cream
And a glass of Momma's sweet tea
This ol' holler's got a way of makin' friends
She'd never seen a glowin' field of fireflies
Or the twinkle of a star in a southern sky

She fell in love
We went down to

Rome Georgia
Picked peaches off the trees
Climbed the water tower in Paris Tennessee
Went to Florence Alabama
Drank muscadine wine
She gave me a chance and I made her mine
Says she'll never fly away and she's my girl
It's 'cause I showed her 'round a country boy'd world

Ooh now she's riding shotgun
Sayin' baby let's run wild
And go down to

Rome Georgia
Pick peaches off the trees
Climb the water tower in Paris Tennessee
Goto Florence Alabama
Drink muscadine wine
She gave me a chance and I made her mine
Says she'll never fly away and she's my girl
It's 'cause I showed her 'round a country boy's world'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
