It happens every time I think about the reasons why
I'm seating here alone at night and not with you.
Heartache takes control and lets me know
Just what a fool I was and how you can't erase the things you do.

And sorry just can't mend a broken heart, I've hand in you
Brake apart is what most broken hearts still you to do.

But I made long long way from over you
Don't think I've ever seen so many shades of blue.
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
'Cause I made long long way from over you.

Now over you the sound like some lost city
People tell me how to find it, somehow I just never do
And maybe it's because I never wanted to it all,
Of course now I see that I had the best in you.

That clock just runs in circles, days just go on' by
Memories hold me closer, no matter how I cry.

I'm still a long long way from over you
Don't think I've ever seen so many shades of blue.
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
'Cause I made long long way from over you.

That clock just runs in circles, days just go on' by
Memories hold me closer, no matter how I cry.

I'm still a long long way from over you
Don't think I've ever seen so many shades of blue.
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
'Cause I made long long way from over you.

C'mon banjo!
How 'bout that mandolin in there
All right flat-top
How 'bout of little pedal steel guitar
Little of Bass 'n' drums now
C'mon everybody!

They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
'Cause I made long long way from over you''''''''''''''''''
