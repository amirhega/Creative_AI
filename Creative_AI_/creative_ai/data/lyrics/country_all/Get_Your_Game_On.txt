Looks like a Johnny Cash
Kicked out the foot lights crowd
We love our country, you know that we love it loud
Gonna set 'em up gonna throw Looks like a Johnny Cash
Kicked out the foot lights crowd
We love our country, you 'em down
It's time to party in a party town

Turn it up, turn it on, turn it loose
Oh oh
Give it everything, win or lose
Oh oh
Time to own it and rock it
Let everybody know you got it
Ya getcha game on

Shake it off, let it rip, gonna let it fly
A little pain ain't no thang, ain't no fear in these eyes
Just getting started, ain't no backin' down
I think it's time to blow the pyro now

Turn it up, turn it on, turn it loose
Oh oh
Give it everything, win or lose
Oh oh
Time to own it and rock it
Let everybody know you got it
Ya getcha game on

Get your game on

Sweat drippin' off the tip of my nose
Mud stains all over my clothes!
Ice water pumpin' through my veins
Hide and watch, we're changin' the game!
Like Pele on a breakaway
One-on-one, tête-à-tête!
Unleash the beast
The flame is on... get your game on!''''&''&''&''&''&''''&''
