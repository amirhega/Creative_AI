Now mama used to always tell me
'Be careful who you pal around
You'll only start actin' like 'em
They'll only up and bring you down'

Some people got the wrong impression
That I'm nothin' but a dirt road hick
They're never gonna see the real real me
'Til I give ol' you know who the slip

No, I don't wanna hang out with me
Gotta find some new company
People wouldn't think mama raised me wrong
If I could only leave myself at home

No, I don't wanna be my friend
Can't nobody talk to me?
He just ain't the guy I thought I'd be
No, I don't wanna hang out with me

Now really, I'm the kinda feller
That likes a quiet evenin' at home
A glass of ice tea beside me
Watchin' TV with my slippers on

But I guess it's kinda hard to see that
While I'm standin' up on this barstool
Screamin' at the band with a beer in my hand
And actin' like a general fool

No, I don't wanna hang out with me
Gotta find some new company
People wouldn't think mama raised me wrong
If I could only leave myself at home

No, I don't wanna be my friend
Can't nobody talk to me?
He just ain't the guy I thought I'd be
No, I don't wanna hang out with me

I don't wanna hang out with me
I got to find some new company
People wouldn't think mama raised me wrong
If I could only leave myself at home

No, I don't wanna be my friend
Can't nobody talk to me?
He just ain't the guy I thought I'd be
No, I don't wanna hang out with me

I think I am my own worst enemy
No, I don't wanna hang out with me'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
