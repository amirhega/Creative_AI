Midnight staring at the ceiling getting so high
Rolling with the feeling just you and I
Your ponytail swinging as you dance alone
I'm about half gone

And the champagne sweating on the table
And the bomb still waiting on the Jager
And you're so smooth I don't need a chaser
When I taste your lips sip by sip 

I got a brand new buzz
It's a lot harder than the whiskey does
One shot of ya and you're in my blood
Oh, and I can't get enough
Wish I could bottle it up, 'cause now I'm hooked on love
Oh, I got a brand new buzz

There's a hundred proof chilled up and waiting
With the blue moon
I hate to waste it, but I've moved on to your temptation
And I'd rather drown in this love I've found

I got a brand new buzz
It's a lot harder than the whiskey does
One shot of ya and you're in my blood
Oh, and I can't get enough
Wish I could bottle it up, 'cause now I'm hooked on love
Oh, I got a brand new buzz

Now I'm done running them bar tabs up
Ain't sneaking no Makers in my coffee cup 
Not a day goes by that I ain't kissing on your good stuff 

I got a brand new buzz
It's a lot harder than the whiskey does
One shot of ya and you're in my blood
Oh, and I can't get enough
Wish I could bottle it up, 'cause now I'm hooked on love
Oh, I got a brand new buzz

I got a brand new buzz
It's a lot harder than the whiskey does
One shot of ya and you're in my blood
Oh, and I can't get enough
Wish I could bottle it up, 'cause now I'm hooked on love
Oh, I got a brand new buzz

I got a brand new buzz 
I got a brand new buzz''''&''&''&''&''&''''''&''&
