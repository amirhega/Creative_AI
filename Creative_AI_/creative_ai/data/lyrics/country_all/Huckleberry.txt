Just off of the two lane where the school bus used to stop
Was a little wooden "A" frame with a yellow tin roof top
And one day it was rainin on this world
She said have you ever really really ever kissed a girl

Baby I'll be your huckleberry you don't have to double dare me
If the storm gets wild and scary
Count on me to be right there your so extra-ordinary
Sweet like marachino cherry we'll grow up and we'll get married
I'm gonna be your huckleberry.

Later on that summer we went to the county fair
They had a brand new roller coaster and everyone was scared
It was two bucks to expierience the thrill she said come on boy
Let's get in line I'll ride it if you will.

Baby I'll be your huckleberry you don't have to double dare me
If the ride gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
Your so extraordinary sweet like marichino cherry
We'll grow up and we'll get married
I'm gonna be your huckleberry.

Snuck off on a slow dance at the junior senior prom
Went lookin' for some romance before I had to get her home
Steamin up the windows of my car
She said until I get my wedding ring boy we can't go that far

Baby I'll be your huckleberry you don't have to double dare me
If the world gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
Your so extraordinary sweet like marichino cherry
We grew up and we got married now look at those three little huckleberries''''''''''''''''''
