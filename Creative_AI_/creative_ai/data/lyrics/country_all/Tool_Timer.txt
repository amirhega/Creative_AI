He works nine to five, five to nine, 99 point 9 per cent of the time,
A motorhead with a bed in the back of his shop.
He's got his eyes on the clock until that Snap-On truck comes.
He shops like a chick, he buys it all on credit, maxed out yeah, but he don't regret it.
'Cause he's in high demand a man's man a modern day wrench slinger with a cellie in his hand

He's a tool timer, sole provider, sweatin for a dollar in his old blue collar.
He don't use a book got it all in his head if worse comes to worst man he'll jump on the web.
Yeah he's flexible takes IOU's or trades work for work tell him what it is that you do.
He's got every tool in the whole wide world, all he needs is a girl

He's got about ten different 9/16's, open end box and everything in between.
Penlight in his pocket, McGyver meets Crockett, if it takes a tool to do it right I guarantee ya he's got it.
Has a tool box lined with gold with a centerfold foldout taped to the side so he's good to go,
He's standard and metric, hydraulic electric, daylight to dark shop doors open and he's hectic.

He's a tool timer, sole provider, sweatin for a dollar in his old blue collar.
He don't use a book got it all in his head if worse comes to worst man he'll jump on the web.
Yeah he's flexible takes IOU's or trades work for work tell him what it is that you do.

He's got every tool in the whole wide world, all he needs is a girl.

One of those white tank top tight jean jaw dropping missus,
To knock him off his feet so sweet like mama's country kisses.
Someone pretty as a pearl with bouncing blonde curls,
Someone to rock his world and be a tool timer girl

He's a tool timer, sole provider, sweatin for a dollar in his old blue collar.
He don't use a book got it all in his head if worse comes to worst he'll just jump on the web.
Yeah he's flexible takes IOU's or trades work for work tell him what it is that you do.
He's got every tool in the whole wide world, all he needs is a girl
