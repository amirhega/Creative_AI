All you girls with your show and tell
Barefoot buzzing and hotter than hell
Throw your hands up, let me hear y'all yell
Say hey hey hey

Ain't no since in heading off to bed
With the cooler half full and your rowdy friends
Hanging with your bud getting out of your head
Saying hey hey hey

Yeah I don't mind if you don't mind
Let's lose a little sleep tonight
No use trying keepin' track of the time
Just worrying bout feeling alright
Gotta song in my ear and a smoke and a beer
Getting sky high
Yeah I don't mind if you don't mind
Let's lose a little sleep tonight

Everybody saying
Hey yeah, let's lose a little sleep tonight
Hey yeah, let's lose a little sleep tonight

Lay it on back with some outlaw souls
Mix a little Jones with your rock and roll
Gonna ride it like an all night rodeo
And saddle on in

Light it on up with electroshine
Spread your love like a dandelion
The sun comes up and we'll hit rewind
And do it all again

Yeah I don't mind if you don't mind
Let's lose a little sleep tonight
No use trying keepin' track of the time
Just worrying bout feeling alright
Gotta song in my ear and a smoke and a beer
Getting sky high
Yeah I don't mind if you don't mind
Let's lose a little sleep tonight

Everybody saying
Hey yeah, let's lose a little sleep tonight
Hey yeah, let's lose a little sleep tonight

Yeah I don't mind if you don't mind
Let's lose a little sleep tonight
No use trying keepin' track of the time
Just worrying bout feeling alright
Gotta song in my ear and a smoke and a beer
Getting sky high
Yeah I don't mind if you don't mind
Let's lose a little sleep tonight

Everybody saying
Hey yeah, let's lose a little sleep tonight
Hey yeah, let's lose a little sleep tonight

Gotta song in my ear and a smoke and a beer
Getting sky high
Yeah I don't mind if you don't mind
Let's lose a little sleep tonight''''&''&''&''&''&''''&''&
