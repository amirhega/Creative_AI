You give in and the night begins with the red wine kiss
I whisper something crazy about your shoes
You hush me and you crush me with your fingertips
It's been awhile since I've seen this side of you

Beautiful stranger in the candle light
God must have told you that I needed this tonight
I've longed for this feeling alone here in the dark
With a beautiful stranger in my arms

There a window moon and and old love tune playing soft and low
Takes me back, I've always loved that song
I pull you in and there's comfort in the shape we make
Wrapped up in each other all night long

Beautiful stranger in the candle light
God must have told you that I needed this tonight
I've longed for this feeling alone here in the dark
With a beautiful stranger in my arms

And we danced and danced like we just met
Girl we made love like we haven't yet, yet

Beautiful stranger in the candle light
God must have told you that I needed this tonight
I've longed for this feeling alone here in the dark
With a beautiful stranger, a beautiful stranger
A beautiful stranger in my arms''''''''''''''''''''
