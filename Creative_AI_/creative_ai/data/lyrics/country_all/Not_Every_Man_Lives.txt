Have you ever skipped a stone across the water
Have you ever hitched a free ride on a train
Have you ever climbed up on a water tower
To write a name

The truth is, Every man dies
Not every man lives

Have you ever loved someone that you would die for
Have you ever walked too far out on a limb
Have you ever chased a dream too high to reach for
And pulled it in

Truth is Every man dies
But Not every man lives

I wanna paint outside the lines
Run the red lights in my mind
Take everything, One lifetime has to give
I wanna stand inside a fire
Walk blind-folded on a wire
Every man dies
But not every man lives



Have you ever thought about how fast time passes
Ever thought about what you would leave behind
Ever stood up for something you believed in
And drawn a line

Truth is every man dies
But not every man lives

I wanna paint outside the lines
Run the red lights in my mind
Take Everything, One lifetime has to give
I wanna stand inside a fire
Walk blind-folded on a wire

Every man Dies
But Not Every Man Lives

I wanna stand inside a fire
Walk Blind-folded on a wire
Every Man Dies
But Not every Man Lives

Have you ever skipped a stone across the water...
Have you ever Hitched a free ride on a train...''''''''''''''''''
