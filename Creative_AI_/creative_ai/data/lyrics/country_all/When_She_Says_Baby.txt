Somedays it's tough just gettin' up
Throwin' on these boots and makin' that climb
Somedays, I'd rather be a no-show, lay low 
Before I go outta my mind

But when she says baby, (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, I ain't goin' nowhere 
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eyes got me comin' alive 
And drivin' me a good kinda crazy 
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby

Some nights, I come home fightin' mad 
Feel like runnin' my fist through the wall
Is it even worth what I'm fightin' for anymore, 
Feelin' torn all the hell with it all

But when she's says baby, (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, I ain't goin' nowhere 
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eyes got me comin' alive 
And drivin' me a good kinda crazy
When she says baby

Everything gonna be alri-i-ight!
Just lay down by my si-i-ide!
Let me love you through this li-i-i-i-ife!

Yeah, she's a perfect shot of faith
When every bit of mine is gone
Somethin' I could believe in, a best friend 
And heaven's sent a love to lean on

But when she's says baby, (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, I ain't goin' nowhere 
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eyes got me comin' alive 
And drivin' me a good kinda crazy

When she says baby

Oh, when she says baby

Yeah, that look in her eyes got me comin' alive 
And drivin' me a good kinda crazy''''''''''''''''''
