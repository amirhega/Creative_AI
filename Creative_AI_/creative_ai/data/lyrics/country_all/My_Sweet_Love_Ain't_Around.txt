Written and recorded by Hank Wiliams Sr.

[C] Listen to ---the rain a-fallin'
Can't you hear ---that lonesome sound [C7]
Oh, my [F] poor ---old heart is [C] breakin'
'Cause my sweet ---love [G7] ain't a-[C] round.

Lord, I think ---I'll start to ramble
Got to leave ---this weary town
This old place ---is way too lonely
'Cause my sweet ---love ain't around.

On that train ---tonight I'm leavin'
And don't ask me ---where I'm bound
I can't stay ---here any longer
'Cause my sweet ---love ain't around.

(Two additional verses not on record)
Mem-o-ries ---come back to haunt me
My dream house ---has done fell down
This old world ---is dark around me
'Cause my sweet ---love ain't around.

Something tells ---me that I'm losing
'Cause these weary ---blues I've found
Oh, my bab- ---y left this morning
Lord, my sweet ---love ain't around.'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
