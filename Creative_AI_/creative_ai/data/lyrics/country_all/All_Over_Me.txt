Well, the weatherman says it's gonna be a hot one
Heard it on the radio
Load up the boat, get your girl if you got one
Nice little breeze gonna blow

Baby, I'm on my way to come and get you
Meet me at the end of your drive
Grab your shades and your string bikini
And your Coppertone 45

Bring on the sunshine, bring on the good time
Girl, let me look at you
Jump in the front seat, kick up your bare feet
Honey, let your hair down too

I know a spot down on the river
Underneath a sycamore tree
Save all your kisses up, bring on your sweet love
Pour it all over me, all over me

We can build us a fire when we run outta daylight
Let it light up your face
Lay on a blanket, listen to the river
Get a little carried away

Well, I can taste that kiss on your sweet lips
Ain't gonna want it to end
So when the morning comes we'll roll on out
And do it all over again

Bring on the sunshine, bring on the good time
Girl, let me look at you
Jump in the front seat, kick up your bare feet
Honey, let your hair down too

I know a spot down on the river
Underneath a sycamore tree
Save all your kisses up, bring on your sweet love
Pour it all over me, all over me

Bring on the sunshine, bring on the good time
Girl, just look at you
Jump in the front seat, kick up your bare feet
Honey, let your hair down too

I know a spot down on the river
Underneath a sycamore tree
Save all your kisses up, bring on your sweet love
Pour it all over me, all over me

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Pour it all over me, all over me''''''''''''''''''
