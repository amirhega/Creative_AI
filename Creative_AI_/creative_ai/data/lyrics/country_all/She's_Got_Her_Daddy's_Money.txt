Let's begin with the day I met her
How fast this good old boys world got better
The sky got bluer, the grass got greener
Just the first few seconds after I first seen her

Like my favorite song on a new set of speakers
My best old jeans and my broken sneakers
A home run pitch floatin' right down the middle
Sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle

She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need, bullseye perfect
She's right on the money

She's no red lights when I've over slept
She's a three point jump shot that's nothin' but net
A hand full of aces when the dealer's done dealin'
I'm forever on a roll that's how she's got me feelin'

She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need, bullseye perfect
She's right on the money

She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
I ain't much around the house but I aim to please
There's absolutely no reason to doubt it
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her

She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need, bullseye perfect
She's right on the money''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
