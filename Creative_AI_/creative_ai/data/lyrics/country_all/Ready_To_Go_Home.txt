There's comin' a day when the world shall melt away
And Jesus shall come to claim His own
No more tears, no pain, no woe, in this wicked world below
Then will you be ready to go home

Will you be ready to go, ready to go home
To live with Him up there around the throne
When He says come unto Me, will your soul be clean and free
Then will you be ready to go home

In this world of greed and hate will you wait till it's too late
To claim the Saviour for your own
For He's coming someday, to bear your soul away
Then will you be ready to go home

As you travel day by day, down life's long highway
Are you on the road that leads to wrong
If you'll just travel in His light and pray both day and night
Then you'll be ready to go home''''''''''''''''''
