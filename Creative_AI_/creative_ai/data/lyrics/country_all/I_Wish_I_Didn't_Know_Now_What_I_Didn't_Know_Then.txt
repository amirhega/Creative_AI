I never ask you where you're goin'
I never ask you where you've been
I've never called and checked your story
When you stayed out with all your friends

I've never tried to catch you lyin'
I didn't want to know the truth
I'd rather go on lovin' blind girl
Than go on lovin' without you

I wish, I didn't know now what I didn't know then
I wish, I could start this whole thing over again
I'm not sayin' that you
You could never be true

I just don't wanna know how it ends
You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hands
I'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah, I wish somehow, I didn't know now what I didn't know then

I've always said what I don't know
Couldn't hurt as bad as leavin' you
Turns out I knew what I was thinkin'
It ain't an easy thing to do

Well, I guess, I should be goin'
I sure found out too much to stay
Please don't say, you're sorry
I might wait another day

I wish, I didn't know now what I didn't know then
I wish, I could start this whole thing over again
I'm not sayin' that you
You could never be true

I just don't wanna know how it ends
You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hands
I'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah, I wish somehow I didn't know now what I didn't know then

You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hand
I'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah, I wish somehow I didn't know now what I didn't know then
Yeah, I wish somehow I didn't know now what I didn't know then''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
