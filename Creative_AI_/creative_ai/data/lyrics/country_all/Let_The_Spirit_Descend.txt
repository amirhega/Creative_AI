Let the spirit descend like a beautiful dove
As it did on Jesus that day
He was baptized by John in the river of Jordan
And God's voice like thunder said, "This is my Son"

When John came preachin', preparin' the way
For Jesus, the Heavenly King
If you'll only trust and believe in His word
You'll stand in God's kingdom and not be ashamed

Let the Spirit descend, like a beautiful dove
As it did on Jesus that day
He was baptized by John in the river of Jordan
And God's voice like thunder said, "This is my Son"''''''''''''''''
