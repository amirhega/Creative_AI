Walkin' and talkin' in America
Are among the rights we share
We do and say what we want
Smile, wave, and try to be fair
But you pissed in our yard and insisted on a fight
We'll do what we do, it's hard NOT to be right
We know about fearing fear, by way of JFK
That don't apply to you Bin labia
We are the "One And Only" U.S. of A.

What you've seen so far is just a sample
Of what can happen to those that wake the giant
Best let the thump do the trick
If we wanted to kick more than your ass
It would also already be kicked
If we wanted your approval, you'd already be compliant
If we wanted your country, it'd be in our pocket
If we wanted saddam, we'd have him in jail
Ooops, been there, done that... gotta say
We are the "One And Only"...U.S. of A.

We're stolkin the train just in case
From a location where it sits based
We don't want to send it, we don't want the flack
Believe this you don't either
You're the dumbass that's on the tracks
Keep on lookin' down them rails
You'll be wonderin what to do
But the train that's coming down your way
Will be disguised as a B-52
We are the "One And Only"...U.S. of A.

If the train does have to leave the station
You're not gonna like it long
You're new word for that day will be
O-----blit---o---ration!
Don't push the buttons of the free
Our buttons are signed
Final gift for you from me
It won't be there for fun, not on that gloomy day
It'll be cause you forgot
The "One And Only"...U.S. of A.''''''''''''''''
