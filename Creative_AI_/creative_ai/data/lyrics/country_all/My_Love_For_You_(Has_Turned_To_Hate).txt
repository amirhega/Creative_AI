I'll ne'er forget that sad, sad day
Darling that you went away
You told me that our love was true
And then you left me 'lone and blue
Yes I received your note today
Saying you'd come back and stay
Don't come back now
It is too late
My love for you has turned to hate

Don't come back now on your knees
Trying to take me back please
Cause you can't mend my broken heart
Because it died when we were apart
Yes I received your note today
Saying you'd Come back and stay
Don't come back now it is too late
My Love for You has turned to hate''''''''''''''''''
