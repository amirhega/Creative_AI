There's a bunch of good women in this big old world
But when I've met you I've found the perfect girl
But it ain't easy, bein' your man
Dealing with these feelings, I do the best I can

'Cause I can't eat and I can't sleep
'Cause I can't believe how you're loving me
It's a full-time job but I'm alright with that
Loving you, that's a good problem to have

Been saving up for a big screen TV
But I'll spend it all on a wedding ring
I'm gonna lose my freedom, we'll walk down the aisle
But I'll be free to love you and get lost in your smile

But I can't eat and I can't sleep
'Cause I can't believe how you're loving me
It's a full-time job but I'm alright with that
Loving you, that's a good problem to have
(Sure is)

You know I can't eat, I can't get no sleep
I can hardly believe how you're loving me
It's a full-time job, I'm alright with that
Loving you, that's a good problem to have

Girl, loving you, that's a good problem to have''''''''''''''''''
