You wanna see what over looks like?
Ya ain't gotta go far, just a few blocks down
You wanna see a picture of goodbye?
Chairs on the table, smoke hanging round
The ceiling from the night before
Light coming through the crack in the door

Nothing says gone like a parking lot with only one car in it
Nothing says gone like an empty glass or sitting on the bar
In the middle of the day in a blue light haze, all alone
Nothing says gone like high noon neon

She could be an airplane blur
Wind in her hair, blowing through another town
Or staring out over a wing, tears on her face
Head in the clouds
It doesn't really matter now

Nothing says gone like a parking lot with only one car in it
Nothing says gone like an empty glass or sitting on the bar
In the middle of the day in a blue light haze, all alone
Nothing says gone like high noon neon

And nothing says gone like 12 o'clock on the rocks
And nothing says over like a parking lot with only one car in it
Nothing says gone like an empty glass or sitting on the bar
In the middle of the day in a blue light haze, all alone
Nothing says gone like high noon neon
Nothing says gone like high noon neon''''''''''''''''''
