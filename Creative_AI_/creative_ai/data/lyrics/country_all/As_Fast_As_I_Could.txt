Baby, I know that you've been waiting patiently
For a man to give you all that you need
Love you like he should

Sticking to your guns, looking for the right one
Just somebody who treats you good
It took me a while but I got here as fast as I could

I ran full speed ahead without stopping to rest
Not knowing where I was headed to
Now that I'm here, it's perfectly clear
That I was making my way to you
Can't believe how long it took
But I got here as fast as I could

I've ended up on at least a hundred dead end roads
Where my heart and I just wound up broke
Lost and misunderstood

I tried to rush finding true love
It didn't pan out like I thought it would
It took me some time but I got here as fast as I could

I ran full speed ahead without stopping to rest
Not knowing where I was headed to
Now that I'm here, it's perfectly clear
That I was making my way to you
Can't believe how long it took
But I got here as fast as I could

I ran full speed ahead without stopping to rest
Not knowing where I was headed to
Now that I'm here, it's perfectly clear
That I was making my way to you
Can't believe how long it took
But I got here as fast as I could

Yeah, I got here as fast as I could''''''''''''''''''
