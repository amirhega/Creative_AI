They boarded up this water town
Ain't nobody hanging 'round
Another grey September day
Was I crazy to think she'd stay

If that sun had just
Hung up in that sky
Just a little
Just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet
Instead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in
Like a warm southern whisper on her
She might have stayed forever
And never ever left these arms
If only I
Had a little more summertime
I brace myself against the cold
And let her memory take hold
Stirring that old fire up
As if I don't miss her enough

If that sun had just
Hung up in that sky
Just a little
Just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at her feet
Instead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in
Like a warm southern whisper on her
She might have stayed forever
And never ever left these arms
If only I
Had a little more summertime
Just a little more summertime

If that sun would have just
Hung up in that sky
Just a little
Just a little bit longer
She might have stayed forever
And never ever left these arms
If only I
Had a little more summertime''''''''''''''''''''''
