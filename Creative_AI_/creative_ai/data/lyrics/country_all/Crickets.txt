Hey pretty girl let's met and take a ride
Chase he moonlight up to the country side
See Heaven is about four turns away
The Sun so sleepy, stars on their way
Let's stay and talk get lost in time
Farm hard walk your hand in mine
Blood is right here begging let the jump
Let's shut up the world and do what we want

Out here at the end of the road,
Out here with the cool breeze cold
The night sky is bright as you get
Out here we can lay up and down
And no one else around
Except you and me and he crickets

This song gets ready to spin my head and it's all good
And your good is mine got the... grand it
Looking at my love, no one you're all mine
Feeling your heart beat through the whispers and pounds
Lost in each other, lost from the world
Found this true love, found my girl
Thank God for this,
Thank God for you
Thank God for good rose from when they let us too

Out here at the end of the dead road,
Out here with the cool breeze cold
The night sky is bright as you get
Out here we can lay up and down
And no one else around
Except you and me and he crickets

We got our own place where our souls are free
Only communication is you loving on me
First step: kiss
Second: who knows
Last step's forever we fell in love

Out here at the end of the dead road,
Out here with the cool breeze cold
The night sky is bright as you get
Out here we can lay up and down
And no one else around
Except you and me and he crickets

Out here at the end of the dead road,
Out here with the cool breeze cold
The night sky is bright as you get
Out here we can lay up and down
And no one else around
Except you and me and he crickets
Ooh crickets''''''''''''''''''
