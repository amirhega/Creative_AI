Bobby wants a ten-speed
An English racer
Jenny wants
That fuzzy teddy-bear
Now your asking me
What I'd like from Santa
For Christmas this year
There's a lot of things
Girl, you could buy for me
But they wouldn't mean as much
As you standing by that tree

Just put a ribbon in your hair
Darlin'
You'll be the best gift anywhere
Christmas mornin'
There's no worldly treasure
I'd like any better
Than you standin' there
Just put a ribbon in your hair

Colored boxes filled
With fancy presents
They were mighty pretty sites
It's true
But all those pretty things
They just can't compare
To the beauty in you
Girl on Christmas day
The greatest gift I know
Will be having you to hold
Underneath the mistletoe

Just put a ribbon in your hair
Darlin'
You'll be the best gift anywhere
Christmas mornin'
There's no worldly treasure
I'd like any better
Than you standin' there
Just put a ribbon in your hair
Just put a ribbon in your hair

(Ooh, baby)''''''''''''''''''
