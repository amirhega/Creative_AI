Grand Old Opry music show playin' on my radio
Fiddle and a steel guitar in some little redneck bar
Parkin' lot full of four wheel drives
You won't hear no hip hop jive
Cowgirls lookin' for cowboys
Two-step to that ol' white noise

I'm talkin' 'bout white noise comin' from the white boys
I can't keep my cowboy boots from stompin'
To that white noise comin' from the white boys
Take me where those honky's are a-tonkin'

When the evenin' sun goes down crusin' through our little town
Country girls and country boys showin' off hillbilly toys

Talkin' 'bout white noise comin' from the white boys
I can't keep my cowboy boots from stompin'
To that white noise comin' from the white boys
Take me where those honky's are a-tonkin'

Tractor pulls and rodeos, county fairs and bluegrass shows
It ain't a thing 'bout black and white
It's Johnny Cash and Charley Pride

It what I call white noise comin' from the real mccoys
I can't keep my cowboy boots from stompin'
To that white noise comin' from the real mccoys
Take me where those honky's are a-tonkin'
Take me where those honky's are a-tonkin'
And take me where those honky's are a-tonkin'''''''''''''''''''
