Baby don't you know I'm a real soul shaker
Baby don't you know I'm gonna catch your world on fire
Gonna take you so high we'll be tearing a hole in the sky
I'm a dynamite daddy, I'll put the rhythm in your blues
I'm not a wishy washy boy like you're ude to

I'm a real soul shaker
I'm a true love maker
I'm a giver and a taker
Yeah, when I give you what I got, you're going to rock
Ain't gonna wam bam, thank you ma'am
I ain't gonna be just another heart breaker
Baby don't you know I'm a real soul shaker

Momma always said, I'd run into a girl like you.
Sweet and smart and stronger than a hundred proof.
You're so fine you'd make a bulldog break his chain.
I gonna wrap you up in love like a hurricane.
And blow you away.

You're like perfect peaches in a tree
(You're like perfect peaches in a tree)
You won't find a better honeybee
A better honey be then me, 'cause

I'm a true love maker
I'm a girlfriend taker
Yeah, when I give you what I got, you're going to rock
Ain't gonna wam bam, thank you ma'am
I ain't gonna be just another heart breaker
Baby don't you know I'm a real soul shaker''''&'''&''&'''&''&'''''''
