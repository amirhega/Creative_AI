Cool song on the radio
FM ESP DJ just readin' my mind (that's fine)
He's a master blaster dancin' round in my underwear
BVD sexy I'm lookin' good (real good)
Oxygen stratocaster
My, my, my mood ring shinin' like a diamond
I got no, got no, got no worries

I'm just diggin' it
Nothin' but net and that's as good as it gets
I'm diggin' it
Clickin' the dial with a satisfied smile
I'm diggin' it
Kiss my grits and call me darlin'
Ain't too proud to beg your pardon
Hey baby life is a garden
I'm diggin' (diggin') diggin' (diggin')
Diggin' (diggin') diggin' it

Whoa

Knock knock who's there
It's a 5 foot somethin' Dixie dunplin' makin' me blush (oh hush)
Give me palpatations
Perfume, bubble gum
Coppertone right to the bone
Got it goin' on (that's strong)
Feelin' excitation
My, my, my, my, my heart is double timin'
You make me, make me, make me
Girl you make me feel so fine

Whoa

My, my, my, my, my heart is double timin'
You make me, make me girl, you make me feel so fine''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
