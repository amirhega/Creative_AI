Her bags are packed and waitin',
For someone to come and pick'em up outside, ah yeah.
I don't know where they come from, man:
I ain't seen that much luggage in my life.
She was always bad about leavin',
Especially every time I done her wrong.
This time she might be through believin' me:
Yeah, this time she might be good as gone, gone, gone.

We'd still be together, but she left me.
I got mad about it, but it never did upset me.
She'll remember me until the day that she forgets me.
We'd still be together but she left me.

She took everything I had,
Execpt some change that she left layin' in an ashtray.
I guess I got that goin' for me,
If I plan on looking at it that way.
She loaded up my boat and my motor.
She took off with my guitar and my guns.
I heard she ran away with my best friend, Jake,
An' I know I'm gonna miss him when it's all said and done.

We'd still be together, but she left me.
I got mad about it, but it never did upset me.
She'll remember me until the day that she forgets me.
Ah, We'd still be together but she left me.

Ah, we'd still be together, but she left me.
I got mad about it, but it never did upset me.
She'll remember me until the day that she forgets me.
We'd still be together but she left me.

My baby left me, yeah.''''''''''''''''''
