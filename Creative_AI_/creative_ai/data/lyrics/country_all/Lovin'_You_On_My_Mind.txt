Baby, if I seem a little bit distracted
Like I'm in an another place and another time, well, well
I apologize for the way I'm acting
I just got a lotta loving you on my mind

Baby, since this morning I've been wondering
How you do that thing you did last night, well, well
Let me tell you, girl, that was really something
That's why I got a lotta loving you on my mind

I walk around and dream about you
Every single minute of everyday
It's all I can do to make it through until the night
I can hardly wait, oh, I can hardly wait

I walk around and dream about you
Every single minute of everyday
It's all I can do to make it through until the night
I can hardly wait, oh girl, I can hardly wait

Girl, the kind of loving you put on me
Ain't no way there's a better kind
So baby, just tell me when you want me
I always got a lotta loving you on my mind
On my mind'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
